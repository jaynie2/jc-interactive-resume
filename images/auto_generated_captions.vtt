I am Dr. Ryan Hilta, the, uh, president

of ICP Singapore,and will be the, uh, the speaker for this session.
So for today's topic, I have decided to discuss to you, uh,
the topics, smart city in the future
of Jobs, Singapore perspective.
Uh, reason being is that as a computer engineer, we look,
we need to look to the future.
And a role model suitable for
that future is Singapore.
So, as we all know, Singapore is one
of the advanced country in Southeast Asia,
and they utilizes technology to advance their citizens,
to advance their economy
and the lifestyle of its people.
With this session, so I will be sharing to you
my experience, my views,
and my, uh, professional practice in Singapore
that will help you to mold, uh, as a future
computer engineer, as a next generation
of computer engineers, which will help
to develop the Philippines to attain its goal to become,
uh, one of the tiger of Southeast Asia.
So, with that, uh, as I mentioned a while ago,
I will be sharing the views, experiences I have in Singapore
need to have some sort of a role model
from other advanced countries such as Singapore,
the United States, Taiwan,
and other advanced countries.
So, for this, uh, session as, uh,
a professional in Singapore for almost 18 years.
So I would like to share with you how Singapore plan
their future, how Singapore utilizes the power

35
00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:10.345
of technology through innovation development,

36
00:02:10.925 --> 00:02:14.985
and in greater extent developing the future of the nation.

37
00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:18.505
So I have here a short video on

38
00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:21.025
how Singapore plan their innovation,

39
00:02:21.685 --> 00:02:24.745
how Singapore utilizes innovation to advance

40
00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:30.585
the civilization, the society, the way of living

41
00:02:30.885 --> 00:02:34.225
of, uh, Singaporeans and the residents of the country,

42
00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:37.905
and how they want to see the future.

43
00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:42.105
So I have here a short video, how Singapore

44
00:02:42.815 --> 00:02:45.225
planned their future, set their future,

45
00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:47.265
and create their future.

46
00:03:08.045 --> 00:03:10.925
Singapore's digital journey is about asking what's next?

47
00:03:11.665 --> 00:03:14.765
How can we build tomorrow with the tools of today?

48
00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:19.725
How can we use technology to make the impossible a reality

49
00:03:20.585 --> 00:03:23.325
and do this in a cleaner, greener way?

50
00:03:24.115 --> 00:03:26.645
This is what Punal digital District stands for.

51
00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:31.125
A campus designed to create our future as a smart nation,

52
00:03:31.805 --> 00:03:33.245
a future for all of us.

53
00:03:35.475 --> 00:03:36.885
Imagine having data

54
00:03:36.985 --> 00:03:39.285
of the entire district at your fingertips.

55
00:03:39.715 --> 00:03:42.365
It's now possible with the open digital platform,

56
00:03:44.315 --> 00:03:47.925
Through Its digital twin ODP also unlocks new

57
00:03:47.925 --> 00:03:49.445
possibilities for innovation.

58
00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:52.485
Tech companies can plug into this virtual world

59
00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:55.605
to access the district data experiment

60
00:03:55.605 --> 00:03:58.365
and test fit solutions before showcasing it live.

61
00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:02.245
At PDD. What if the future

62
00:04:02.305 --> 00:04:06.165
of learning is not confined to the classroom at PDD?

63
00:04:06.405 --> 00:04:09.285
Experiential and authentic learning comes to life

64
00:04:09.425 --> 00:04:12.565
as we transform our campus into a living lab for students,

65
00:04:13.325 --> 00:04:14.725
businesses, and the community.

66
00:04:15.315 --> 00:04:16.965
This unparalleled proximity

67
00:04:17.145 --> 00:04:20.645
to industry will bring about synergies like never before.

68
00:04:22.135 --> 00:04:24.045
Youth have incredible diversity

69
00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:27.125
and perspectives as they reimagine our world.

70
00:04:27.425 --> 00:04:30.685
We hope to empower them to be ready for the digital future.

71
00:04:31.685 --> 00:04:35.165
PDD is a nexus for the brightest minds in tech to connect

72
00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:37.405
and collaborate on the next big innovation.

73
00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:42.525
So we are excited to be part of this vibrant ecosystem

74
00:04:43.145 --> 00:04:46.285
and help you bridge the gap between dreams and action

75
00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:48.805
At Pungo Digital District. The future.

76
00:04:49.145 --> 00:04:51.805
The future. The future is yours to discover,

77
00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:54.365
Yours to imagine yours to transform.

78
00:04:54.545 --> 00:04:56.525
The future is yours to create.

79
00:04:59.395 --> 00:05:01.365
Alright, So as you've seen from the video,

80
00:05:02.285 --> 00:05:05.645
Singapore utilizes, uh, technology to develop their future.

81
00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:10.405
So they believe that, uh, technology will empower the future

82
00:05:10.505 --> 00:05:12.085
of their society

83
00:05:12.555 --> 00:05:15.885
because, uh, they look into it as a way

84
00:05:15.905 --> 00:05:17.685
to advance their civilization

85
00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:22.805
and to advance the development of, uh, uh,

86
00:05:22.805 --> 00:05:24.565
the economic economy of the country.

87
00:05:25.345 --> 00:05:30.195
The, uh, what we call it, the improvement of,

88
00:05:30.295 --> 00:05:32.395
uh, livelihood of the community.

89
00:05:32.935 --> 00:05:37.435
And then they also look into what we call, uh, virtual

90
00:05:38.465 --> 00:05:42.515
simulations of the, uh, environment wherein, uh,

91
00:05:42.545 --> 00:05:45.715
various players of the industry can participate.

92
00:05:46.055 --> 00:05:47.995
So they can simulate the impact

93
00:05:48.055 --> 00:05:51.915
of developing infrastructure, uh, in a particular area.

94
00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:55.755
They can do some sort of a twin tower development,

95
00:05:55.895 --> 00:05:58.605
how this development will implicate the

96
00:05:58.605 --> 00:05:59.805
community as a whole.

97
00:06:00.185 --> 00:06:03.485
And then they also try to simulate

98
00:06:04.105 --> 00:06:07.745
how education can be done in a remote fashion.

99
00:06:07.815 --> 00:06:10.145
Meaning the learning will not only

100
00:06:10.685 --> 00:06:13.265
be confined in the four corners of the classroom,

101
00:06:13.265 --> 00:06:15.945
but also in the outside the campus.

102
00:06:16.525 --> 00:06:20.385
So that's how they want to perceive, uh, their society,

103
00:06:20.605 --> 00:06:22.945
how they want to advance their, uh,

104
00:06:23.255 --> 00:06:25.505
development into that context.

105
00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:29.145
So with that, the, the technology itself, the, the test bed

106
00:06:29.145 --> 00:06:30.745
that they're using is, uh,

107
00:06:30.865 --> 00:06:32.745
I can say it is 50 years in advance.

108
00:06:33.285 --> 00:06:35.345
So that is how they plan the future.

109
00:06:35.565 --> 00:06:37.985
So they create the future they want to be,

110
00:06:38.495 --> 00:06:41.065
they create the future that they want to see.

111
00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:44.945
So it is not just a, uh, reactive on a given situation,

112
00:06:44.965 --> 00:06:47.705
but they create an opportunity for them so

113
00:06:47.705 --> 00:06:51.345
that they will be ready when it time, uh, it comes.

114
00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:56.475
So the underlying of all of this technology, uh, is

115
00:06:56.585 --> 00:06:59.155
what we call first the context of the internet of things.

116
00:06:59.695 --> 00:07:01.395
So the internet of things as, uh,

117
00:07:01.395 --> 00:07:02.795
just some sort of an introduction.

118
00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:05.395
So it is a, uh, a technology.

119
00:07:05.615 --> 00:07:08.395
We are in a machine, communicate to each other

120
00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:12.595
and communicate to other elements in the eco,

121
00:07:12.595 --> 00:07:13.635
in the ecosystem.

122
00:07:14.095 --> 00:07:15.635
So this includes human

123
00:07:16.655 --> 00:07:20.675
and then also the, uh, the machines talking to a machine,

124
00:07:21.295 --> 00:07:25.445
and then people talking to the, the infrastructure itself.

125
00:07:25.835 --> 00:07:29.605
Okay? So that is the backbone of all of this, uh, smart city

126
00:07:29.745 --> 00:07:30.965
or smart development.

127
00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:36.685
So also when we look into components

128
00:07:36.705 --> 00:07:41.245
or of the elements of the I OT technology, so they have, uh,

129
00:07:41.315 --> 00:07:43.725
this, uh, event driven context.

130
00:07:43.985 --> 00:07:45.125
So event driven context.

131
00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:49.925
Technically, the, uh, the system itself is, uh, driven by

132
00:07:50.505 --> 00:07:52.845
the changes on the environment.

133
00:07:52.845 --> 00:07:56.405
Technically, for example, there is a changes in temperature.

134
00:07:56.465 --> 00:07:57.845
So therefore the system will

135
00:07:58.515 --> 00:08:01.405
respond on the sudden changes on the temperature.

136
00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:04.725
And then, uh, for example, they notice

137
00:08:04.725 --> 00:08:08.005
that the temperature in the office is not anymore conducive

138
00:08:08.105 --> 00:08:09.445
for the people working there.

139
00:08:09.865 --> 00:08:12.805
So they will adjust the temperature conducive for them.

140
00:08:13.465 --> 00:08:16.925
So, because, uh, there's a lot of, uh, uh, study

141
00:08:17.035 --> 00:08:20.475
that when the people are not, uh, comfortable

142
00:08:20.475 --> 00:08:24.955
with the workplace, so they tend to do some other things.

143
00:08:25.215 --> 00:08:28.395
So they may, uh, take a break longer breaks

144
00:08:28.495 --> 00:08:29.955
or reducing their productivity.

145
00:08:30.535 --> 00:08:34.285
So this is all parts of what we call smart, uh, ecosystem.

146
00:08:35.465 --> 00:08:38.605
And then, uh, they are also sensitive to the context,

147
00:08:38.635 --> 00:08:39.725
technically context

148
00:08:39.985 --> 00:08:42.405
or on the, uh, area they are,

149
00:08:42.865 --> 00:08:45.125
uh, sensitive.

150
00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:47.485
So aside from the temperature, we,

151
00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:48.885
we can also look on the motion.

152
00:08:49.865 --> 00:08:53.205
And then, uh, if it is in the, uh,

153
00:08:53.495 --> 00:08:58.125
industrial application, so we can look into, uh,

154
00:08:58.485 --> 00:09:01.365
sensitive on, uh, some type of gases

155
00:09:01.365 --> 00:09:02.845
that are flammable in nature.

156
00:09:03.545 --> 00:09:07.285
So if this sensor detect this kind of flammable, uh, gases,

157
00:09:07.385 --> 00:09:11.205
the sensor will, uh, activate the, uh,

158
00:09:12.605 --> 00:09:16.295
environment in a sense that it'll, uh, flush out this,

159
00:09:16.435 --> 00:09:18.055
uh, kind of gases.

160
00:09:18.055 --> 00:09:22.055
This is to prevent any damages inside the laboratory

161
00:09:22.685 --> 00:09:25.575
that may cause, uh, the lives

162
00:09:26.615 --> 00:09:29.635
of the people working in the particular industry.

163
00:09:30.595 --> 00:09:34.565
And then also they have this, uh, uh,

164
00:09:35.155 --> 00:09:37.725
flexibility of the, the structure.

165
00:09:38.145 --> 00:09:41.085
So meaning they can scale up and scale down the system.

166
00:09:41.665 --> 00:09:44.285
So that makes the, uh, the smart system

167
00:09:44.425 --> 00:09:48.565
or smart city development, uh, a more,

168
00:09:49.465 --> 00:09:50.645
uh, we call it robust.

169
00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:54.135
Then we also have a semantic sharing.

170
00:09:54.595 --> 00:09:57.935
So nowadays, you don't need to be worried about the,

171
00:09:58.035 --> 00:09:59.735
uh, manufacturer.

172
00:10:00.515 --> 00:10:02.935
You don't need to be worried about, uh,

173
00:10:03.195 --> 00:10:04.455
who developed the technology,

174
00:10:04.455 --> 00:10:05.815
because nowadays they have this,

175
00:10:05.815 --> 00:10:07.135
what we call the standardization.

176
00:10:07.715 --> 00:10:10.375
So with the standardization, we can say

177
00:10:10.495 --> 00:10:12.895
that the devices can communicate

178
00:10:12.915 --> 00:10:15.495
and talk to each other seamlessly.

179
00:10:16.575 --> 00:10:18.795
And then also they have this last component,

180
00:10:18.905 --> 00:10:21.515
complex access, uh, technology.

181
00:10:21.575 --> 00:10:24.955
So technically this is, uh, the, uh, the power consumption

182
00:10:25.335 --> 00:10:28.115
of all of this, uh, uh, technology

183
00:10:28.115 --> 00:10:30.435
because, you know, the, the one who powers all

184
00:10:30.435 --> 00:10:34.725
of this technology is the, uh, uh,

185
00:10:35.065 --> 00:10:36.365
the power source itself,

186
00:10:36.365 --> 00:10:38.925
because, uh, the more complex the machine,

187
00:10:38.945 --> 00:10:40.325
the more power it requires.

188
00:10:40.425 --> 00:10:41.565
But we also need

189
00:10:41.565 --> 00:10:44.365
to develop some sophistications on their power sources.

190
00:10:44.945 --> 00:10:46.925
So that's why they have this, uh, development

191
00:10:46.985 --> 00:10:50.285
of energy in terms of, uh, for example,

192
00:10:50.355 --> 00:10:54.525
improvement the battery life of the IO OT

193
00:10:55.065 --> 00:10:59.085
in a given, uh, environment, or for example, in the farm.

194
00:10:59.705 --> 00:11:02.245
So they make sure that the battery life there will,

195
00:11:02.555 --> 00:11:06.885
will last, okay, uh, as expected, right?

196
00:11:06.905 --> 00:11:10.605
So all of these are the characteristics of this, uh, iot

197
00:11:10.605 --> 00:11:12.325
as a backbone of the,

198
00:11:12.385 --> 00:11:17.385
the smart city development and moving

199
00:11:18.205 --> 00:11:21.425
So when we apply all of this in various industries,

200
00:11:21.965 --> 00:11:24.985
so we can develop at what we call intelligent system,

201
00:11:25.565 --> 00:11:28.585
and this intelligent system can communicate to each other,

202
00:11:28.645 --> 00:11:33.545
making us more connected, making us more engaged,

203
00:11:33.815 --> 00:11:36.385
whether you are in the manufacturing,

204
00:11:36.615 --> 00:11:41.345
whether you are in the retail or in the, uh, medical field.

205
00:11:42.005 --> 00:11:46.265
So we can easily engage each other technically.

206
00:11:46.385 --> 00:11:49.145
I, for example, now I am in Hong Kong,

207
00:11:49.285 --> 00:11:51.385
so I can engage you there in the Philippines

208
00:11:51.685 --> 00:11:54.525
to provide you some, uh, perspectives

209
00:11:54.545 --> 00:11:58.445
and views of the IT practitioner, uh, on

210
00:11:58.465 --> 00:12:00.445
how you could apply all of this,

211
00:12:00.745 --> 00:12:02.685
either in your research area

212
00:12:03.345 --> 00:12:07.125
or in the, uh, sharing of, uh, what we call the experience

213
00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:09.965
so that our students will have a more relevant

214
00:12:09.965 --> 00:12:12.045
and responsive skillset

215
00:12:12.755 --> 00:12:14.525
once they graduate in the university.

216
00:12:17.435 --> 00:12:19.255
All right? So I, OT

217
00:12:19.255 --> 00:12:23.355
and smart system, so the components of that are three.

218
00:12:23.935 --> 00:12:25.875
So technically the first one is the sensor.

219
00:12:26.255 --> 00:12:28.355
So from the word sensor, it is the one sensing

220
00:12:28.455 --> 00:12:30.155
the environment.

221
00:12:30.295 --> 00:12:32.395
So capturing all of those parameters.

222
00:12:32.815 --> 00:12:37.515
So these parameters can be the form of, uh, liquid, okay?

223
00:12:38.095 --> 00:12:39.535
Gas motion.

224
00:12:40.655 --> 00:12:43.555
So all of those parameters, these parameters are fed

225
00:12:44.175 --> 00:12:46.715
to the system for processing.

226
00:12:47.255 --> 00:12:49.075
And then after that, we have connectivity.

227
00:12:49.255 --> 00:12:51.475
So this is the communication line.

228
00:12:51.975 --> 00:12:55.795
So how the data is transmitted from the sensing edge

229
00:12:56.535 --> 00:12:58.155
to the processing system.

230
00:12:58.815 --> 00:13:02.435
So this can be in the form of wire or wireless system.

231
00:13:02.775 --> 00:13:05.475
And of course, inside the connectivity, you have

232
00:13:05.475 --> 00:13:08.795
to consider also the type of, uh, networks

233
00:13:08.825 --> 00:13:09.915
that you will be using.

234
00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:13.795
So it can be in 5G or LTE

235
00:13:14.415 --> 00:13:17.115
or wifi, Bluetooth.

236
00:13:17.845 --> 00:13:19.505
So it depends on the application,

237
00:13:19.505 --> 00:13:22.105
but technically in general, they are connectivity.

238
00:13:22.965 --> 00:13:26.425
And then on the last part, you have the processes.

239
00:13:26.445 --> 00:13:28.225
So technically this is the, the system,

240
00:13:28.325 --> 00:13:31.825
the computing system, and the people using, using it.

241
00:13:31.925 --> 00:13:35.345
So they are the one who developing the dashboard,

242
00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:40.225
providing a, a more meaningful insight to the management so

243
00:13:40.225 --> 00:13:43.105
that the man management can provide some, uh,

244
00:13:43.895 --> 00:13:47.065
substantial support to develop all of this, uh,

245
00:13:47.115 --> 00:13:48.145
smart technology.

246
00:13:49.175 --> 00:13:52.635
Okay? So as, uh, I mentioned a while ago,

247
00:13:52.635 --> 00:13:55.395
the sensors are those, uh, devices

248
00:13:56.185 --> 00:13:58.155
that captures environmental data.

249
00:13:58.215 --> 00:14:00.115
So this one can be in the form as mentioned,

250
00:14:00.115 --> 00:14:05.035
it can be in the form of, uh, uh, gases or a position

251
00:14:05.895 --> 00:14:08.635
or, uh, acceleration.

252
00:14:09.665 --> 00:14:11.675
Okay? And then magnetic field.

253
00:14:12.575 --> 00:14:15.755
So all of these are part of the sensing capabilities,

254
00:14:15.755 --> 00:14:18.995
because sensor nowadays are becoming more

255
00:14:19.015 --> 00:14:21.195
and more advanced, unlike before.

256
00:14:21.735 --> 00:14:24.675
So technically the sensor last time is just a matter of,

257
00:14:24.975 --> 00:14:26.195
uh, on and off switch.

258
00:14:26.375 --> 00:14:28.595
So if I detect something, I know it is off.

259
00:14:28.695 --> 00:14:30.595
If not, it is on something like that.

260
00:14:31.055 --> 00:14:32.635
So nowadays, it is different.

261
00:14:32.975 --> 00:14:36.235
So they can detect, if they can detect specific amount

262
00:14:36.235 --> 00:14:39.075
of gas, and they know that it doesn't reach the threshold,

263
00:14:39.075 --> 00:14:41.715
they will not do something because it doesn't reach the

264
00:14:42.075 --> 00:14:44.395
critical, the critical can be in a sense

265
00:14:44.395 --> 00:14:46.675
that it can create more damage already.

266
00:14:47.335 --> 00:14:50.515
All right? So that's how sensing capabilities are,

267
00:14:51.065 --> 00:14:52.445
uh, advanced nowadays.

268
00:14:55.235 --> 00:14:57.295
All right. So for the connectivity, as I mentioned,

269
00:14:57.315 --> 00:14:59.375
it can be in the form of wire or wireless,

270
00:15:00.115 --> 00:15:03.055
and depending also on the scope, okay?

271
00:15:03.515 --> 00:15:07.535
So if it is, for example, your devices talking to

272
00:15:08.125 --> 00:15:10.895
another devices in a short distance, it can be

273
00:15:11.575 --> 00:15:12.775
a personal area network.

274
00:15:13.035 --> 00:15:15.735
So meaning to say it can be in the form of Bluetooth,

275
00:15:16.115 --> 00:15:17.735
so just a small range.

276
00:15:18.485 --> 00:15:22.535
Then if it is a more higher range, it can be a land setting.

277
00:15:23.325 --> 00:15:26.855
Okay? So wider, that is the man setting, then

278
00:15:27.835 --> 00:15:28.855
one, okay?

279
00:15:29.355 --> 00:15:31.655
So under the one, you have various types,

280
00:15:31.655 --> 00:15:33.375
you have the lower one, okay?

281
00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:34.815
So there are so many variations.

282
00:15:35.555 --> 00:15:39.335
And then after that, you have the, uh, LTE,

283
00:15:40.235 --> 00:15:43.895
the four, G, 5G, and the satellite communication.

284
00:15:43.895 --> 00:15:47.935
So it depends on the application of the, uh,

285
00:15:48.185 --> 00:15:52.995
smart system and right for the people and processes.

286
00:15:52.995 --> 00:15:56.075
So this comprises of, for example, we have the, uh,

287
00:15:56.785 --> 00:15:58.725
analytics, okay?

288
00:15:59.345 --> 00:16:03.925
And then some, uh, uh, customer management solution.

289
00:16:04.665 --> 00:16:07.285
So all of these technically are providing, uh,

290
00:16:07.635 --> 00:16:10.285
computational, uh, processes,

291
00:16:10.905 --> 00:16:13.645
and then the people using the system will be able

292
00:16:13.705 --> 00:16:15.765
to develop some dashboard.

293
00:16:16.345 --> 00:16:18.005
And then this dashboard can be used

294
00:16:18.005 --> 00:16:20.485
by the management for decision making.

295
00:16:20.545 --> 00:16:22.845
And technically, they use it for an insight,

296
00:16:22.845 --> 00:16:26.765
because normally what the management wants is, uh,

297
00:16:26.865 --> 00:16:28.805
to see a glimpse of the future so

298
00:16:28.805 --> 00:16:30.325
that they can develop something

299
00:16:30.465 --> 00:16:32.805
before the future happen, right?

300
00:16:34.845 --> 00:16:38.615
Okay. So as I mentioned a while ago, IO OT comprises of

301
00:16:39.215 --> 00:16:41.215
a machine to machine, okay?

302
00:16:41.235 --> 00:16:42.655
Or things talking to things,

303
00:16:43.235 --> 00:16:45.415
and then also a things talking to people.

304
00:16:46.355 --> 00:16:49.295
And now this includes also a data, right?

305
00:16:49.315 --> 00:16:53.015
So a data, okay, uh, can communicate also

306
00:16:53.015 --> 00:16:54.575
to the machine, okay?

307
00:16:54.845 --> 00:16:58.055
Through we call, uh, what we call this, uh,

308
00:16:59.695 --> 00:17:03.375
uh, an AI driven approach, okay?

309
00:17:03.755 --> 00:17:06.135
And then when we combine all of this, it can be

310
00:17:06.245 --> 00:17:08.135
what we call the internet of everything.

311
00:17:08.155 --> 00:17:11.465
So it is a combinations of people to people, people

312
00:17:11.565 --> 00:17:14.065
to machine and machine to machine communication.

313
00:17:14.125 --> 00:17:17.265
So it is already what we call an ecosystem, uh,

314
00:17:17.285 --> 00:17:20.905
an alternative ecosystem of the machine, of the human

315
00:17:21.045 --> 00:17:23.545
and of the data interacting to each other,

316
00:17:23.915 --> 00:17:27.025
developing a more complex, sophisticated

317
00:17:27.125 --> 00:17:27.985
and intelligent

318
00:17:28.375 --> 00:17:32.455
environment, okay?

319
00:17:32.555 --> 00:17:35.775
And then, uh, the interactions between these entities

320
00:17:36.685 --> 00:17:39.225
are creating new types of smart applications

321
00:17:39.245 --> 00:17:41.185
and services, so, which we already know.

322
00:17:41.565 --> 00:17:46.025
So for example, uh, developing, uh, an application in,

323
00:17:46.445 --> 00:17:49.765
for example, a smart car park solution or car park system.

324
00:17:50.345 --> 00:17:54.365
So you could develop an IOT, uh, technology there wherein,

325
00:17:54.825 --> 00:17:58.205
uh, all the parking space have the sensing capability.

326
00:17:58.825 --> 00:18:02.845
So if the, the sensor connecting the top

327
00:18:02.845 --> 00:18:06.365
and the bottom is being blocked, so technically there is,

328
00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:09.125
uh, a car parking there already, so signifying

329
00:18:09.125 --> 00:18:11.085
that the block is already occupied, right?

330
00:18:11.545 --> 00:18:14.605
So as a commuter, so you know, which parking area

331
00:18:14.745 --> 00:18:17.445
or parking space still have a slot for you to,

332
00:18:17.625 --> 00:18:18.645
to park your car.

333
00:18:18.865 --> 00:18:21.045
So this creates something like an inside.

334
00:18:21.345 --> 00:18:24.405
So it creates something like a, a more, uh,

335
00:18:25.135 --> 00:18:26.725
productive time on your end.

336
00:18:27.145 --> 00:18:28.445
So no need just to go there.

337
00:18:28.445 --> 00:18:30.245
And then at the end of the day, you cannot find any

338
00:18:30.245 --> 00:18:31.365
parking space for you.

339
00:18:32.265 --> 00:18:37.025
All right? And then also you have here a, uh, a system

340
00:18:37.495 --> 00:18:39.385
that develops your day-to-day activity,

341
00:18:39.485 --> 00:18:44.335
so it can detect your number of steps taken every day,

342
00:18:44.885 --> 00:18:47.015
your heart rate, your pulse rate.

343
00:18:47.435 --> 00:18:51.655
So all of this creates what we call a a, an insight, okay?

344
00:18:51.995 --> 00:18:55.495
So this data can, can, can develop something like, uh,

345
00:18:57.025 --> 00:19:01.765
an information for your doctor to see your, uh,

346
00:19:01.765 --> 00:19:05.125
we call it health information, right?

347
00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:08.765
So whether or not, uh, the doctor can advise you to do

348
00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:13.485
more exercise or to, to reduce some, uh, food intake.

349
00:19:13.745 --> 00:19:17.285
So this is a more what we call proactive, uh,

350
00:19:17.645 --> 00:19:18.685
approach, okay?

351
00:19:18.685 --> 00:19:21.245
Because at the end of the day, the, the idea

352
00:19:21.425 --> 00:19:26.325
of this smart system is to, uh, provide more,

353
00:19:27.215 --> 00:19:31.095
uh, advancement in terms of quality of life,

354
00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:36.475
and to, of course, to prevent loss of,

355
00:19:36.575 --> 00:19:38.715
uh, property, damage of property,

356
00:19:38.775 --> 00:19:39.955
and of course loss of life.

357
00:19:40.015 --> 00:19:42.915
So that is the technical essence of smart development.

358
00:19:43.925 --> 00:19:48.155
All right? And then as for the applications

359
00:19:48.155 --> 00:19:51.555
and services, so you could look into different, uh,

360
00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:55.795
classifications and examples of IOT by

361
00:19:56.805 --> 00:20:01.585
scale and by the, uh, network range.

362
00:20:02.085 --> 00:20:06.825
So for example, you have a, a body area network typed, okay?

363
00:20:06.825 --> 00:20:09.345
So the type of network there would be a personal area

364
00:20:09.345 --> 00:20:11.745
network, meaning the machine is talking

365
00:20:12.125 --> 00:20:14.585
to another machine using a Bluetooth, right?

366
00:20:14.585 --> 00:20:16.625
Because the, the communication range

367
00:20:16.625 --> 00:20:19.705
of Bluetooth is much smaller than the wifi.

368
00:20:21.005 --> 00:20:24.985
So technically you use, uh, this to measure your

369
00:20:25.495 --> 00:20:27.785
body temperature, humidity,

370
00:20:28.575 --> 00:20:31.025
your pulse rate, et cetera, right?

371
00:20:31.645 --> 00:20:35.835
But if you enlarge the size, okay?

372
00:20:35.975 --> 00:20:40.595
So making it a more bigger in, in, in, in scale.

373
00:20:41.135 --> 00:20:43.315
So it can be in the form of, uh,

374
00:20:43.795 --> 00:20:46.315
activity monitoring in a given area.

375
00:20:46.455 --> 00:20:49.445
For example, it is a, uh, a basketball court,

376
00:20:49.625 --> 00:20:52.605
so you could see how the players move, okay?

377
00:20:52.945 --> 00:20:54.445
And then if you expand it more

378
00:20:54.505 --> 00:20:56.685
so you could apply it into a smart house

379
00:20:57.475 --> 00:21:01.765
wherein the house would have a different, uh, level, right?

380
00:21:01.825 --> 00:21:03.365
So level one, level two, level three,

381
00:21:03.365 --> 00:21:06.045
but all of them can be captured, okay?

382
00:21:06.105 --> 00:21:07.685
And then you expand that more.

383
00:21:08.065 --> 00:21:10.765
So you can apply that one in the field of agriculture

384
00:21:11.315 --> 00:21:12.605
livestock monitoring.

385
00:21:12.705 --> 00:21:14.925
So you could see what is happening to your cows,

386
00:21:15.255 --> 00:21:18.605
where are they, what are they eating, okay?

387
00:21:18.665 --> 00:21:20.205
And then also in the smart grid.

388
00:21:20.865 --> 00:21:23.125
And then putting that one more bigger,

389
00:21:23.225 --> 00:21:25.525
you have the transportation and logistic.

390
00:21:26.105 --> 00:21:30.645
So you can see where your, uh, deliveries are coming, okay?

391
00:21:30.675 --> 00:21:32.325
When, when, and when they will be coming.

392
00:21:32.825 --> 00:21:34.605
And then to expand that more.

393
00:21:34.865 --> 00:21:36.685
So you have a tsunami detection.

394
00:21:36.745 --> 00:21:40.045
So meaning, uh, it is assure, okay?

395
00:21:40.105 --> 00:21:43.965
So, uh, it, it takes more,

396
00:21:44.785 --> 00:21:47.195
uh, distance coverage.

397
00:21:47.415 --> 00:21:51.125
So that is how it, uh, applies

398
00:21:51.265 --> 00:21:52.645
to this kind of application.

399
00:21:52.665 --> 00:21:55.405
So technically, if you will look at it, uh,

400
00:21:55.665 --> 00:21:57.685
it is more on getting information

401
00:21:58.105 --> 00:22:02.985
and to develop a more proactive approach to manage all

402
00:22:02.985 --> 00:22:07.105
of those resources in our advantage in

403
00:22:08.225 --> 00:22:09.945
creating a more sustainable

404
00:22:10.285 --> 00:22:13.705
and more beneficial to us human in general.

405
00:22:14.375 --> 00:22:17.945
Okay? All right.

406
00:22:18.205 --> 00:22:19.505
And then for the application,

407
00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:21.225
so you have here the smart cities.

408
00:22:21.725 --> 00:22:25.785
So we, wherein you can manage the resources utilizes

409
00:22:25.925 --> 00:22:27.585
by the cities, okay?

410
00:22:27.605 --> 00:22:29.705
So because in small city, you have to utilize

411
00:22:31.005 --> 00:22:32.265
the consumption, so

412
00:22:32.365 --> 00:22:35.745
how much people consume in one city, okay?

413
00:22:35.925 --> 00:22:37.305
And also if there is a consumption,

414
00:22:37.305 --> 00:22:38.945
there is also waste generated.

415
00:22:39.085 --> 00:22:42.305
So what will you do with this, uh,

416
00:22:42.305 --> 00:22:43.825
waste generated in the cities?

417
00:22:44.045 --> 00:22:48.265
Do you have a sufficient facilities to dispose all

418
00:22:48.265 --> 00:22:49.665
of this waste generated?

419
00:22:50.425 --> 00:22:54.645
And together with the energy they require, they need?

420
00:22:54.985 --> 00:22:58.525
So technically developing a city is not just building homes,

421
00:22:59.145 --> 00:23:02.365
but also you need to develop a system that will enable

422
00:23:02.915 --> 00:23:04.805
what we call sustainable development.

423
00:23:05.395 --> 00:23:08.805
Okay? And then another application is the smart environment.

424
00:23:09.695 --> 00:23:14.155
So this one is creating a more, uh, infrastructure,

425
00:23:14.635 --> 00:23:19.435
creating more, uh, technology that are, uh,

426
00:23:19.985 --> 00:23:21.035
environment friendly.

427
00:23:22.135 --> 00:23:25.065
Okay? So for example, in in Singapore, we have here

428
00:23:25.745 --> 00:23:28.525
a plastic that are, uh,

429
00:23:29.445 --> 00:23:32.045
disintegrate in a given period of time.

430
00:23:32.385 --> 00:23:35.485
So let's say, as far as I know, we have here a plastic bag

431
00:23:35.955 --> 00:23:38.485
that can disintegrate within 60 days.

432
00:23:38.905 --> 00:23:41.765
So you see the plastic here can decompose,

433
00:23:41.765 --> 00:23:42.845
meaning they become bri,

434
00:23:43.305 --> 00:23:45.605
and it it become like a paper, right?

435
00:23:45.665 --> 00:23:46.725
Unlike in the Philippines,

436
00:23:46.725 --> 00:23:48.005
the plastic there would last forever.

437
00:23:48.825 --> 00:23:52.205
So that this is how they, they make a material, uh,

438
00:23:52.685 --> 00:23:55.085
a more user friendly, okay?

439
00:23:55.705 --> 00:23:59.445
And also, uh, for example, they, they use here, okay?

440
00:23:59.665 --> 00:24:04.555
In, in Singapore also, one of the, uh, part

441
00:24:04.615 --> 00:24:06.515
of the sustainability they have

442
00:24:07.135 --> 00:24:11.675
is all the trashes in Singapore are, uh, incinerated,

443
00:24:12.295 --> 00:24:15.745
but incineration is banned in the Philippines.

444
00:24:15.745 --> 00:24:17.305
But in Singapore it is not.

445
00:24:17.645 --> 00:24:20.345
How, because they, they do it in a different way.

446
00:24:20.345 --> 00:24:23.385
It is that just dumping outside and then burn it there?

447
00:24:23.525 --> 00:24:26.225
No, in Singapore, they, they do it in different way.

448
00:24:26.565 --> 00:24:30.145
So they have his, uh, there, uh, under, uh,

449
00:24:31.055 --> 00:24:33.305
underground incineration.

450
00:24:33.965 --> 00:24:35.865
So they burn all of this material.

451
00:24:36.805 --> 00:24:40.145
And then, uh, there are two byproducts here.

452
00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:43.225
So the first one is the, the solids.

453
00:24:43.605 --> 00:24:48.305
So those, uh, materials are used, used in construction.

454
00:24:48.925 --> 00:24:50.385
So they use those material,

455
00:24:50.445 --> 00:24:52.745
the byproduct in construction, okay?

456
00:24:52.745 --> 00:24:54.025
They use it in the parks.

457
00:24:54.025 --> 00:24:56.345
They use it for repairing some other, uh,

458
00:24:56.355 --> 00:24:59.345
minor infrastructure there in Singapore.

459
00:24:59.405 --> 00:25:02.465
And then also the other byproduct there is the heat.

460
00:25:03.005 --> 00:25:05.425
So the heat generated there, uh, they use it

461
00:25:05.425 --> 00:25:10.345
to power the turbine to, to generate energy, right?

462
00:25:10.845 --> 00:25:13.265
And then the smoke, they process it farther so

463
00:25:13.265 --> 00:25:16.185
that the smoke will become less, okay?

464
00:25:16.615 --> 00:25:20.585
Less, uh, uh, the impact to this, to the environment.

465
00:25:20.605 --> 00:25:23.025
So technically there is negligible, okay?

466
00:25:23.025 --> 00:25:24.305
Because in the Philippines, the smoke,

467
00:25:24.305 --> 00:25:26.985
when you burn become black, white, uh, black, right?

468
00:25:27.045 --> 00:25:29.825
But in Singapore it is white. So that is how they do it.

469
00:25:30.045 --> 00:25:33.505
So they are developing technology so that the impact

470
00:25:33.565 --> 00:25:37.785
of those technology in the environment is less, okay?

471
00:25:38.365 --> 00:25:39.945
And then smart energy.

472
00:25:40.525 --> 00:25:44.785
So smart energy in, in Europe, they have this, uh,

473
00:25:46.005 --> 00:25:49.385
uh, we call it, uh, energy sharing.

474
00:25:50.095 --> 00:25:51.465
Okay? So what does it mean?

475
00:25:51.465 --> 00:25:55.065
In, in Europe, uh, they have this grid, okay?

476
00:25:55.065 --> 00:25:58.025
They have European union, they have this common grid.

477
00:25:58.365 --> 00:26:00.705
So for example, France develop energy

478
00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:03.745
or produce energy more than they need.

479
00:26:04.165 --> 00:26:08.225
So the excess energy can be exported to other

480
00:26:09.225 --> 00:26:10.905
European union country, okay?

481
00:26:11.325 --> 00:26:15.105
So to ensure that the other European country can have also,

482
00:26:15.725 --> 00:26:19.265
uh, an energy source to, to power their economy.

483
00:26:19.485 --> 00:26:20.985
So that is how they work.

484
00:26:21.085 --> 00:26:24.505
So, so there is a no waste stage of energy

485
00:26:24.505 --> 00:26:27.445
because the energy will not last forever.

486
00:26:27.905 --> 00:26:30.085
So the excess energy should be utilized

487
00:26:30.545 --> 00:26:33.045
by other member state, okay?

488
00:26:33.065 --> 00:26:36.325
So that is how they do it, okay? Smart agriculture.

489
00:26:36.705 --> 00:26:39.605
So you utilizing technology

490
00:26:40.545 --> 00:26:45.415
to produce products in, in the whole year, okay?

491
00:26:45.475 --> 00:26:46.895
So unlike in the Philippines, right?

492
00:26:47.115 --> 00:26:49.775
So we do have season, but in other countries,

493
00:26:49.775 --> 00:26:52.855
they can have those particular products whole year round.

494
00:26:53.435 --> 00:26:56.255
Why? Because they can control the environment

495
00:26:56.875 --> 00:26:58.135
to make this products

496
00:26:58.315 --> 00:27:01.895
or, uh, foods available all year round.

497
00:27:02.825 --> 00:27:05.645
And then eHealth. So the utilizing technology

498
00:27:06.225 --> 00:27:08.925
to monitor your vitals, okay?

499
00:27:09.025 --> 00:27:12.965
To, to measure all of those critical vitals needed for your,

500
00:27:13.625 --> 00:27:17.765
uh, for example, your survival itself, your health, okay?

501
00:27:18.105 --> 00:27:21.685
So they, they have this, uh, technology to your body,

502
00:27:21.785 --> 00:27:25.885
and then this, uh, uh, data are posted to the cloud,

503
00:27:26.625 --> 00:27:30.285
and then this information can be viewed by your doctor,

504
00:27:31.145 --> 00:27:35.365
so the doctor can see a more advanced, uh, findings.

505
00:27:35.385 --> 00:27:38.085
So that can provide a more, uh,

506
00:27:38.975 --> 00:27:41.165
preventive measure than a reactive,

507
00:27:41.165 --> 00:27:43.965
because if it is reactive, so the damage has been done,

508
00:27:44.065 --> 00:27:47.485
but if it is a preventive, so it is more sustainable

509
00:27:47.485 --> 00:27:50.385
because it prevents things to happen, right?

510
00:27:50.405 --> 00:27:54.505
And then in the field of re retail, so it, the utilizing iot

511
00:27:55.245 --> 00:27:58.185
in terms of, uh, consumption.

512
00:27:59.605 --> 00:28:02.305
So how much people consume in a particular city.

513
00:28:02.925 --> 00:28:04.945
So they can do what we call projection.

514
00:28:05.125 --> 00:28:08.945
So if this product consume, okay, using data analytics,

515
00:28:09.225 --> 00:28:10.945
I know how many items

516
00:28:11.125 --> 00:28:13.745
or product do I need to produce in the coming months

517
00:28:13.745 --> 00:28:15.605
or season, right?

518
00:28:15.715 --> 00:28:17.325
Then together with the logistics.

519
00:28:17.325 --> 00:28:19.285
So logistics is a partner of retails.

520
00:28:20.225 --> 00:28:25.005
So how many, uh, uh, truck ban will I need

521
00:28:25.005 --> 00:28:26.925
to deploy so that all of those items

522
00:28:27.565 --> 00:28:28.765
produced can be delivered

523
00:28:29.225 --> 00:28:31.325
to the respective destination, right?

524
00:28:31.385 --> 00:28:32.645
And then industrial control.

525
00:28:32.985 --> 00:28:36.045
So industrial control, these are the, uh, what we call, uh,

526
00:28:36.825 --> 00:28:38.125
uh, an iot

527
00:28:38.125 --> 00:28:40.565
or intelligence system in a critical infrastructure.

528
00:28:41.955 --> 00:28:46.255
So these are the, uh, infrastructure that are, uh,

529
00:28:46.515 --> 00:28:48.255
in the power, okay?

530
00:28:48.385 --> 00:28:51.495
Power generation in communication system.

531
00:28:52.155 --> 00:28:55.415
So, so they need to, to ensure that all

532
00:28:55.415 --> 00:28:57.215
of these are taken care of,

533
00:28:57.215 --> 00:28:59.415
because imagine if your critical

534
00:28:59.415 --> 00:29:01.015
infrastructure is compromised.

535
00:29:01.595 --> 00:29:04.735
So it will, for example, it downs your communication system.

536
00:29:05.115 --> 00:29:06.175
So what will happen then?

537
00:29:06.755 --> 00:29:09.215
So, okay, uh, in the, in the airport, for example,

538
00:29:09.435 --> 00:29:13.895
if your communication power is down, so plane cannot go out

539
00:29:13.995 --> 00:29:15.495
and go into your country

540
00:29:15.645 --> 00:29:18.295
because they cannot see who's going down and going up.

541
00:29:18.555 --> 00:29:21.055
So it can, it might cause a collision, right?

542
00:29:21.435 --> 00:29:23.495
So the same thing with the iot.

543
00:29:23.495 --> 00:29:26.735
So they need to ensure that there is a proper, uh, a system

544
00:29:26.795 --> 00:29:31.665
to, uh, ensure con communication, connectivity,

545
00:29:32.245 --> 00:29:34.105
and of course, and insight so

546
00:29:34.105 --> 00:29:38.005
that the traffic controller can mitigate, uh,

547
00:29:38.265 --> 00:29:40.885
any collision, any accident that may happen.

548
00:29:41.305 --> 00:29:44.845
So that is only in the, uh, in the airport.

549
00:29:45.105 --> 00:29:48.405
So you also have the, the ports in harbo.

550
00:29:49.135 --> 00:29:52.595
So you, Pierre, so how many ships are coming in,

551
00:29:52.595 --> 00:29:54.035
coming out, okay?

552
00:29:54.055 --> 00:29:56.675
And then the, the, the size of the ship, right?

553
00:29:57.055 --> 00:30:00.155
So, so they, the, the need to anticipate that.

554
00:30:00.215 --> 00:30:01.915
So, but with the power of iot

555
00:30:01.975 --> 00:30:04.955
and data analytics, so they know when they will come,

556
00:30:05.065 --> 00:30:07.075
when they need to push out, right?

557
00:30:07.175 --> 00:30:09.035
So it is a matter of, uh,

558
00:30:09.035 --> 00:30:12.905
intelligent solution, okay?

559
00:30:12.925 --> 00:30:16.825
For the smart home. So for example, you have here, uh,

560
00:30:16.845 --> 00:30:18.105
an IOT system

561
00:30:18.205 --> 00:30:22.065
or an intelligent system in general, so you can, can control

562
00:30:22.065 --> 00:30:24.065
what is happening inside your homes, right?

563
00:30:24.125 --> 00:30:27.345
So for example, there is no one at home, so

564
00:30:28.125 --> 00:30:30.545
the lights will be off automatically,

565
00:30:30.565 --> 00:30:31.785
but if the system detects

566
00:30:31.785 --> 00:30:34.785
that there is someone walking there, so it detects

567
00:30:34.785 --> 00:30:37.785
that there is a motion, therefore the light will be

568
00:30:37.805 --> 00:30:39.045
on, right?

569
00:30:39.065 --> 00:30:42.485
So something like that. And then if your grandparents, uh,

570
00:30:42.695 --> 00:30:43.845
strip, okay?

571
00:30:43.945 --> 00:30:47.325
And then fall. So the system will send notification

572
00:30:47.425 --> 00:30:51.725
to the family members that there is something happen, okay?

573
00:30:51.725 --> 00:30:53.165
Some accident happen at home.

574
00:30:53.665 --> 00:30:57.885
So they can immediately call 9 1 1 to do, uh,

575
00:30:59.775 --> 00:31:02.895
a rescue or a, any, uh,

576
00:31:04.495 --> 00:31:08.025
advance, uh, we call it rescue if needed.

577
00:31:08.495 --> 00:31:10.465
Okay? So all of this,

578
00:31:10.725 --> 00:31:12.985
and at the end of the day, what you will see here is that,

579
00:31:13.565 --> 00:31:15.825
uh, it reduce energy consumption, right?

580
00:31:15.825 --> 00:31:18.145
Because if there is none there, no one is there.

581
00:31:18.445 --> 00:31:22.485
So energy consumption will be lower, right? Okay.

582
00:31:23.955 --> 00:31:25.605
Okay. For the smart home, again,

583
00:31:25.605 --> 00:31:27.725
another application is your fridge, okay?

584
00:31:27.725 --> 00:31:30.605
In other countries, I've seen this one in Europe, okay?

585
00:31:30.865 --> 00:31:33.845
So in the fridge, so there are sensors there.

586
00:31:33.905 --> 00:31:38.445
So, so can, they can measure, okay, how many, uh, meat left,

587
00:31:38.625 --> 00:31:41.885
how many eggs left there, how many vegetable left there,

588
00:31:42.225 --> 00:31:44.245
and then all of this information is sent

589
00:31:44.245 --> 00:31:45.525
to the app, to the apps.

590
00:31:45.825 --> 00:31:49.565
And then the apps can be viewed by the, the, uh, the parents

591
00:31:49.905 --> 00:31:53.005
or the mother, because normally the mother is the one buying

592
00:31:53.195 --> 00:31:55.205
them to the groceries after office.

593
00:31:55.905 --> 00:32:00.205
So with this, uh, technology, smart technology, so they

594
00:32:00.955 --> 00:32:04.205
need not to go to the fridge and check one by one.

595
00:32:04.205 --> 00:32:06.485
So by the apps itself, they can see, right?

596
00:32:06.545 --> 00:32:10.955
So making a, uh, grocery more, uh,

597
00:32:11.225 --> 00:32:12.315
easy, okay?

598
00:32:12.375 --> 00:32:16.555
And then more, uh, we call it, um, appropriate.

599
00:32:16.735 --> 00:32:19.315
So meaning to say it avoids overstocking

600
00:32:19.315 --> 00:32:21.115
because for example, you don't have idea.

601
00:32:21.495 --> 00:32:23.395
So you thought that there are no more eggs.

602
00:32:23.815 --> 00:32:26.235
So, but actually there's still a lot, right?

603
00:32:26.375 --> 00:32:29.035
So if you buy, again, it overstock, right?

604
00:32:29.135 --> 00:32:32.795
And then some means spoil, right?

605
00:32:32.855 --> 00:32:35.755
So, so this is one of those, uh, advantages

606
00:32:35.755 --> 00:32:38.445
of technology, okay?

607
00:32:38.545 --> 00:32:40.335
And then also in Singapore, I just want

608
00:32:40.335 --> 00:32:41.815
to share something, okay?

609
00:32:41.815 --> 00:32:45.215
In general here, as I mentioned a while ago, it, it helps

610
00:32:45.795 --> 00:32:50.145
the, the government manage their resources.

611
00:32:50.855 --> 00:32:55.345
Okay? So managing resources includes energy, okay?

612
00:32:55.825 --> 00:32:59.585
Building a more, uh, friendly community

613
00:32:59.765 --> 00:33:01.385
or homes, okay?

614
00:33:01.735 --> 00:33:06.025
Providing a more responsive, uh, support

615
00:33:06.085 --> 00:33:07.265
to the community itself.

616
00:33:07.325 --> 00:33:10.425
So for example, if they need, uh, police assistance,

617
00:33:11.125 --> 00:33:14.425
it can be easily, uh, provided, okay?

618
00:33:15.205 --> 00:33:19.345
And then, uh, the government also here provides, uh,

619
00:33:20.005 --> 00:33:22.145
uh, what we call, as mentioned earlier, right?

620
00:33:22.285 --> 00:33:26.065
Uh, provides a more conducive environment for

621
00:33:26.575 --> 00:33:28.305
working in the case of the office.

622
00:33:28.485 --> 00:33:30.305
But in, in, in Singapore, they also monitor

623
00:33:30.925 --> 00:33:32.585
the air flow, okay?

624
00:33:32.605 --> 00:33:33.705
In a given community.

625
00:33:33.705 --> 00:33:36.785
That's why in Singapore, you seldom see

626
00:33:36.815 --> 00:33:39.585
that the building is attached to another building

627
00:33:40.125 --> 00:33:41.745
and then attached to another building,

628
00:33:42.325 --> 00:33:45.225
making it the air difficult to flow through.

629
00:33:45.815 --> 00:33:49.265
Okay? So, so in, in Singapore, they also plant

630
00:33:49.265 --> 00:33:52.185
that including the sunrise, the sunset, the heat,

631
00:33:52.925 --> 00:33:54.025
uh, direction.

632
00:33:54.095 --> 00:33:55.985
They plan everything, okay?

633
00:33:55.985 --> 00:33:59.505
Because they know, uh, when, when all of this is, uh,

634
00:33:59.605 --> 00:34:04.025
put into place, they create a more, uh, friendly community

635
00:34:04.025 --> 00:34:07.465
because they are not, uh, they are more or less stressed.

636
00:34:07.685 --> 00:34:08.905
We can say that. Okay?

637
00:34:09.205 --> 00:34:12.185
So I have in some video for you to look into how

638
00:34:12.865 --> 00:34:15.505
Singapore manages all of these resources.

639
00:37:50.905 --> 00:37:53.045
All right? So you can see from the video, right?

640
00:37:53.595 --> 00:37:58.445
That, uh, the Singapore government manages all of this, uh,

641
00:37:59.105 --> 00:38:00.125
uh, resources.

642
00:38:00.225 --> 00:38:03.205
So electrical consumption, right?

643
00:38:03.225 --> 00:38:07.365
So you see from the video, the, the light is also, uh,

644
00:38:07.435 --> 00:38:10.205
activated on a given period, right?

645
00:38:10.345 --> 00:38:13.445
And then also they deem the light, okay?

646
00:38:13.585 --> 00:38:14.765
So if needed to,

647
00:38:14.945 --> 00:38:19.325
and then also with the use of technology, you can see, uh,

648
00:38:19.325 --> 00:38:22.285
what is happening to your parents at home, right?

649
00:38:22.745 --> 00:38:27.445
So if they doing some, uh, rec corporation activity together

650
00:38:27.555 --> 00:38:32.005
with the, uh, remote, uh, consultant, right?

651
00:38:32.145 --> 00:38:34.885
So you can see, okay, so the checkup has been completed.

652
00:38:35.145 --> 00:38:38.125
So something like that. So it gives more, uh, peace

653
00:38:38.125 --> 00:38:41.165
of mind on the end of the, the, the children, right?

654
00:38:41.795 --> 00:38:43.765
Okay. So, so this is, uh, how it works.

655
00:38:43.825 --> 00:38:46.445
And then another point that I want to raise there, you see,

656
00:38:46.825 --> 00:38:50.925
uh, they utilizes, uh, technology in, uh,

657
00:38:51.385 --> 00:38:53.525
infrastructure monitoring

658
00:38:53.665 --> 00:38:58.085
or, uh, building health monitoring

659
00:38:58.385 --> 00:39:01.285
so they can see if the building's still in a good condition.

660
00:39:01.305 --> 00:39:04.205
So if there is a crop, so what is the impact of the crop

661
00:39:04.305 --> 00:39:06.965
to the overall structure of the building, right?

662
00:39:07.025 --> 00:39:09.445
Do they need the repair or do they need to do what?

663
00:39:09.945 --> 00:39:13.165
So something like that, so that in the next development,

664
00:39:13.195 --> 00:39:14.685
they know what to do so

665
00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:17.525
that the same event will not happen again, right?

666
00:39:17.545 --> 00:39:21.165
And then another point, they also utilizing technology

667
00:39:21.945 --> 00:39:24.485
in smart urban planning, right?

668
00:39:24.665 --> 00:39:28.125
So that is, I believe one of the important thing

669
00:39:28.125 --> 00:39:30.885
that we need to incorporate in the Philippines,

670
00:39:30.945 --> 00:39:32.725
or even in the field of teaching.

671
00:39:33.305 --> 00:39:34.845
So smart urban planning,

672
00:39:34.845 --> 00:39:36.965
because that's, uh, uh,

673
00:39:37.755 --> 00:39:40.485
very vol thing if we don't include.

674
00:39:40.745 --> 00:39:43.885
So if you develop a city in a place that is, that suitable

675
00:39:44.025 --> 00:39:45.045
for city development,

676
00:39:45.505 --> 00:39:48.805
so it will create more damage than benefits.

677
00:39:49.435 --> 00:39:53.415
Okay? All right.

678
00:39:53.555 --> 00:39:54.935
So we have smart cars.

679
00:39:54.995 --> 00:39:56.815
So I think this one is self-explanatory

680
00:39:56.815 --> 00:39:59.415
because there's a lot of applications nowadays in the

681
00:39:59.415 --> 00:40:00.655
Philippines, right?

682
00:40:00.755 --> 00:40:04.015
To, to provide you, uh, a navigation, right?

683
00:40:04.075 --> 00:40:06.735
So we will just key in your destination

684
00:40:06.835 --> 00:40:09.295
and then automatically detect your current location,

685
00:40:09.355 --> 00:40:12.015
and then after that, you just follow it, right?

686
00:40:12.035 --> 00:40:16.195
So it is in, in ways, right? So in the Philippines, okay?

687
00:40:17.055 --> 00:40:21.315
And then also aside from that, in Singapore, they also,

688
00:40:22.015 --> 00:40:26.155
uh, already explore the, uh, what we call smart,

689
00:40:27.015 --> 00:40:29.475
uh, car or the autonomous vehicle,

690
00:40:29.915 --> 00:40:32.275
although it is not yet, uh, in production.

691
00:40:32.815 --> 00:40:35.915
But they already have this proof of concept utilized this


in, uh, one of the campus in Singapore University campus,
that is the Nanyang Technological University.
So they, uh, employ this autonomous vehicle nside the campus premise, okay?
So they have this autonomous bus service.

So this bus service is only in the campus of the NTU,

but prior to that, uh, they do have this, uh, uh,

evaluation, okay?

Test evaluation, how they can employ this, uh,

technology, okay?

In, in this, uh, area.
So actually it was tested by some of the expert,
including the, the then, uh, minister Vivian Nan,
which is the current foreign minister of Singapore.
So they tested it, the, the, the benefits of technology,
and then how they can improve the technology.
Okay? So with that, I, I will just play this video so
that you can see how really Singapore
are serious about this, uh, development.
Okay?
Uh, when we kick started this project, our initial goals

and objective is to how to use autonomous systems
to improve people's life.
Yeah. And also, another of our goals is how do we use this
autonomous systems to create a new industry?

717
00:41:59.415 --> 00:42:01.315
So we kick started with small vehicles.

718
00:42:01.365 --> 00:42:04.115
First of all, what we have done is, uh, we have, uh, tried

719
00:42:04.115 --> 00:42:06.755
to customize the vehicles to be drive by wire capable.

720
00:42:07.215 --> 00:42:08.715
And, uh, we've sensor integrations.

721
00:42:09.135 --> 00:42:11.555
And, uh, then we start to develop the perceptions

722
00:42:11.575 --> 00:42:13.915
that's been the needs to understand the world.

723
00:42:14.335 --> 00:42:16.555
And, uh, we start to do localizations.

724
00:42:16.575 --> 00:42:18.115
The vehicle need to know where am I?

725
00:42:19.145 --> 00:42:23.155
This is a small robots that, uh, tries to

726
00:42:23.715 --> 00:42:24.915
represent a child.

727
00:42:26.095 --> 00:42:28.435
So he is able to detect as at a very far distance,

728
00:42:28.735 --> 00:42:32.075
we are stopping and see what is the situation proceeds

729
00:42:32.825 --> 00:42:35.955
what we, not only that we are detecting the vehicles in

730
00:42:35.955 --> 00:42:37.915
front, but we are detecting vehicles

731
00:42:38.295 --> 00:42:41.915
behind whether there's vehicles, uh, coming towards us

732
00:42:41.915 --> 00:42:43.155
before we do a lane change.

733
00:42:43.335 --> 00:42:45.955
If there is vehicles behind us, we also do a stop.

734
00:42:46.025 --> 00:42:48.795
Also, what we are doing right now is that, uh,

735
00:42:49.135 --> 00:42:51.275
we are detect detecting where is the curb?

736
00:42:51.605 --> 00:42:53.715
Where is the lane you are even able

737
00:42:53.715 --> 00:42:55.515
to classify which lane are we right now?

738
00:42:55.575 --> 00:42:59.235
Are we at the double double lane zone, pedestrian detected,

739
00:42:59.795 --> 00:43:01.315
stopping pedestrian ahead

740
00:43:08.115 --> 00:43:09.115
All? So you see

741
00:43:09.115 --> 00:43:11.655
that it's the, the power of technology.

742
00:43:11.795 --> 00:43:16.335
So they utilizes this smart system into vehicle,

743
00:43:16.435 --> 00:43:19.175
making it an autonomous vehicle.

744
00:43:22.935 --> 00:43:25.915
All right? So another context that they, uh, utilizing

745
00:43:25.915 --> 00:43:28.755
or advancing here is the eHealth.

746
00:43:29.135 --> 00:43:32.515
So how technology can fuse to healthcare.

747
00:43:33.335 --> 00:43:38.075
So, uh, in Singapore, one of the, uh, the problem

748
00:43:38.225 --> 00:43:40.795
that the country facing is the aging population.

749
00:43:41.615 --> 00:43:44.995
So those, uh, group or

750
00:43:45.055 --> 00:43:49.075
or sector of the society as they age, okay?

751
00:43:49.615 --> 00:43:53.875
So they have this, uh, some sort of, uh, uh,

752
00:43:55.585 --> 00:43:57.465
sickness called dementia, okay?

753
00:43:57.765 --> 00:44:01.625
So technically dementia is the degradations of, uh,

754
00:44:01.645 --> 00:44:02.865
the brain health itself.

755
00:44:03.605 --> 00:44:05.625
So why it happened.

756
00:44:05.805 --> 00:44:10.145
So normally based on research in Singapore, they say one

757
00:44:10.145 --> 00:44:13.625
of the cause of dementia is, uh, loneliness

758
00:44:13.765 --> 00:44:17.945
and lack of, uh, interaction with the community.

759
00:44:18.325 --> 00:44:20.825
So because your brain become more stagnant, okay?

760
00:44:20.825 --> 00:44:23.305
So therefore you becoming more

761
00:44:24.365 --> 00:44:27.385
and more less engaged, okay?

762
00:44:27.985 --> 00:44:32.285
Isolated, then it has a, a greater impact

763
00:44:32.285 --> 00:44:35.525
to your brain activity, which leads to dementia.

764
00:44:36.025 --> 00:44:38.885
So in Singapore to address that issue, okay?

765
00:44:39.225 --> 00:44:43.285
So they employ technology to engage this aging population

766
00:44:43.625 --> 00:44:47.885
to make them, again, active, active in terms of thinking,

767
00:44:48.745 --> 00:44:50.965
in terms of mobility, okay?

768
00:44:50.965 --> 00:44:54.405
Because they, they, they want this, uh, group of people to,

769
00:44:54.625 --> 00:44:57.565
to, to enjoy life, to the fullest, meaning

770
00:44:57.585 --> 00:45:01.925
to extend their life at least, and, and enjoy those period.

771
00:45:02.385 --> 00:45:06.165
So in, in Singapore, they have this, uh, digital,

772
00:45:07.185 --> 00:45:09.045
uh, assistant, okay?

773
00:45:09.295 --> 00:45:12.445
Which I will be shown later. Okay?

774
00:45:13.945 --> 00:45:16.085
So I think, wait, let me check. Okay?

775
00:45:16.085 --> 00:45:17.885
So this is what I am talking about earlier.

776
00:45:18.265 --> 00:45:21.965
So they have this center for healthcare, assistive

777
00:45:21.965 --> 00:45:23.085
and robotics technology.

778
00:45:23.085 --> 00:45:24.365
So they develop this robot

779
00:45:24.865 --> 00:45:29.085
and, uh, provides some, uh, a more, uh,

780
00:45:29.725 --> 00:45:33.205
engaging, uh, experience to this aging population.

781
00:45:33.745 --> 00:45:36.685
So from there, they, they, they see that the effects

782
00:45:36.705 --> 00:45:40.725
of dementia, though it is not, uh, significantly meaning

783
00:45:40.725 --> 00:45:44.005
to say it is not reduced, but at least gradually improving.

784
00:45:44.145 --> 00:45:48.085
And then those aging population that are not yet subjected,

785
00:45:48.235 --> 00:45:52.565
meaning still showing, uh, a sign of dementia, uh, the, uh,

786
00:45:53.105 --> 00:45:54.565
the symptoms have been reversed

787
00:45:55.035 --> 00:45:59.045
because the, this group of people, uh, feel that they are,

788
00:45:59.625 --> 00:46:01.765
uh, still have worked, okay?

789
00:46:01.785 --> 00:46:03.725
And then they, they feel, uh,

790
00:46:04.395 --> 00:46:06.965
that they still have something to do, okay?

791
00:46:06.965 --> 00:46:08.965
They, they feel happy about what they're doing.

792
00:46:09.385 --> 00:46:13.285
So, so the, the, the symptoms have been reversed. Okay?

793
00:46:13.385 --> 00:46:17.925
So I have this video, okay, from the, uh, uh,

794
00:46:18.405 --> 00:46:19.525
salvation Army Singapore.

795
00:46:19.585 --> 00:46:22.565
So they, they show how this technology g

796
00:46:24.345 --> 00:46:29.235
improve the, uh, healthcare of this, uh,

797
00:46:30.505 --> 00:46:32.115
society, group of society.

798
00:46:32.865 --> 00:46:33.865
Okay?

799
00:48:05.875 --> 00:48:06.165
Warm,

800
00:48:16.345 --> 00:48:17.345
You.

801
00:48:29.255 --> 00:48:29.765
Thank you.

802
00:48:33.925 --> 00:48:36.415
Alright. So you see the, uh,

803
00:48:37.175 --> 00:48:39.015
robotics technology, D right?

804
00:48:39.555 --> 00:48:44.015
So it creates a more engaging activity

805
00:48:45.025 --> 00:48:49.335
experience to this, uh, aging population, which, uh,

806
00:48:50.235 --> 00:48:54.815
uh, creates a more happy environment, right?

807
00:48:54.995 --> 00:48:56.415
For this, uh, aging people,

808
00:48:56.415 --> 00:48:59.855
because we know as we age, we become more and more emotional

809
00:49:00.125 --> 00:49:04.455
because of lack of, uh, we call it interaction with them,

810
00:49:04.515 --> 00:49:05.535
but with the technology.

811
00:49:05.775 --> 00:49:08.975
D dixie. So Dixie, uh, interact with them

812
00:49:09.115 --> 00:49:11.095
by singing, okay?

813
00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:14.415
Do some, uh, physical activity, right?

814
00:49:14.555 --> 00:49:19.335
So that's why technology, uh, is a great help, okay?

815
00:49:19.355 --> 00:49:21.975
To extend our life, right?

816
00:49:22.075 --> 00:49:24.295
And then also, if you see, uh,

817
00:49:24.485 --> 00:49:27.215
this technology is also used in the field of healthcare.

818
00:49:27.595 --> 00:49:31.535
So this is part of overall, uh, holistic development

819
00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:35.615
of smart ct, because they manage the resources, okay?

820
00:49:35.955 --> 00:49:38.695
So this includes our wellbeing, okay?

821
00:49:38.795 --> 00:49:43.015
As part of the, uh, considered resource in the city.

822
00:49:44.105 --> 00:49:48.895
Okay? All right, so let's go to the agriculture.

823
00:49:48.955 --> 00:49:50.255
So in the smart farms.

824
00:49:50.275 --> 00:49:53.935
So in here, so you also employ technology to monitor your,

825
00:49:54.475 --> 00:49:55.935
uh, resources in the farm.

826
00:49:56.075 --> 00:49:58.775
So these are the machines in truck tour, right?

827
00:49:59.235 --> 00:50:01.095
And then the farmers, okay?

828
00:50:01.115 --> 00:50:04.175
And then the, the animals in the farms itself.

829
00:50:04.235 --> 00:50:08.135
So you could see where are they? So where are my cows?

830
00:50:08.315 --> 00:50:10.415
Are they eating well? Okay?

831
00:50:10.715 --> 00:50:14.735
Are they having, uh, symptoms of pregnancy?

832
00:50:14.955 --> 00:50:18.895
Are they having some, uh, viral infection?

833
00:50:19.135 --> 00:50:22.095
I, the, the system will tell you all of this, okay?

834
00:50:22.095 --> 00:50:25.815
So with the technology, so it prevents, uh, loss

835
00:50:25.955 --> 00:50:28.005
of your cartels, right?

836
00:50:28.145 --> 00:50:31.965
So we, we can do what we call a preventive, uh, measure,

837
00:50:32.105 --> 00:50:34.765
so we can isolate them so that, uh,

838
00:50:34.785 --> 00:50:37.605
the other cartels will not be infected as well, right?

839
00:50:37.955 --> 00:50:39.885
Otherwise, all of them will get infected.

840
00:50:40.315 --> 00:50:44.365
Then later on, it'll be more, uh, cost on the farm

841
00:50:44.745 --> 00:50:45.925
or on the operator

842
00:50:46.395 --> 00:50:50.685
because, uh, they, they need to hire a vet for all

843
00:50:50.685 --> 00:50:51.845
of those infected.

844
00:50:52.065 --> 00:50:54.165
So, which is already, uh,

845
00:50:55.715 --> 00:50:59.245
scattered, right?

846
00:50:59.385 --> 00:51:03.165
But with the technology, you can employ segregation

847
00:51:03.185 --> 00:51:06.985
and you monitor what is happening to them, okay?

848
00:51:07.915 --> 00:51:11.615
And then also aside from that, okay, Singapore as a small,

849
00:51:11.745 --> 00:51:16.575
small country, so they have limited, okay,

850
00:51:16.805 --> 00:51:18.455
land resource, okay?

851
00:51:18.955 --> 00:51:21.135
And then since they are limited in land resource,

852
00:51:21.235 --> 00:51:23.695
so they cannot have this, uh,

853
00:51:24.735 --> 00:51:27.055
agricultural farm, okay?

854
00:51:27.875 --> 00:51:29.335
So they cannot have that.

855
00:51:29.365 --> 00:51:33.295
Instead, what they are trying to do is to use technology

856
00:51:34.155 --> 00:51:36.855
to produce at least a portion of that, okay?

857
00:51:36.875 --> 00:51:41.055
To, to, to at least augment to their food supply.

858
00:51:41.555 --> 00:51:44.095
So they employ, uh, some sort of, uh,

859
00:51:44.225 --> 00:51:46.735
smart technology in agriculture.

860
00:51:47.195 --> 00:51:51.535
So, for example, if they want to produce a, uh, a variation

861
00:51:51.955 --> 00:51:54.655
of, uh, specific, uh, let's say lettuce.

862
00:51:55.395 --> 00:52:00.375
So there are study that the lettuce is, uh, produce is,

863
00:52:00.495 --> 00:52:04.575
uh, affect, uh, uh, affected by the environment.

864
00:52:05.235 --> 00:52:08.785
So let's say if you want to have a more, uh,

865
00:52:09.375 --> 00:52:12.225
crunchier letter, so you have to use specific types

866
00:52:12.225 --> 00:52:13.465
of light, okay?

867
00:52:13.525 --> 00:52:17.945
So to LED, light signal, spectrum, light spectrum.

868
00:52:18.645 --> 00:52:21.505
So if you want to use a, a specific spectrum,

869
00:52:22.215 --> 00:52:26.025
then the lettuce will be more sweet than normal.

870
00:52:26.645 --> 00:52:27.745
So they utilize that

871
00:52:27.745 --> 00:52:30.785
because if, if it is in, in, in the normal farm,

872
00:52:31.005 --> 00:52:33.305
so they use the la the light of the sun, right?

873
00:52:33.645 --> 00:52:36.185
And the light of the sun have scattered spectrum.

874
00:52:36.685 --> 00:52:39.865
So kala, so Hindi uniform.

875
00:52:40.365 --> 00:52:42.785
But if you put that one in a control environment

876
00:52:42.805 --> 00:52:44.625
and use a concentrated spectrum,

877
00:52:45.375 --> 00:52:47.945
then your lettuce will grow depending on

878
00:52:47.945 --> 00:52:49.625
that light spectrum that you use.

879
00:52:50.045 --> 00:52:53.585
So if you want to have a more crunch air, uh, lettuce,

880
00:52:53.845 --> 00:52:58.345
so you will use a speci specific type of, uh, LED, light,

881
00:52:59.115 --> 00:53:00.945
light spectrum, right?

882
00:53:01.005 --> 00:53:05.425
So in the field of science, so technically they use science

883
00:53:05.605 --> 00:53:08.425
to develop specific, uh, type of produce.

884
00:53:08.745 --> 00:53:10.705
'cause it depending play.

885
00:53:10.705 --> 00:53:13.625
And if the client wants to have this kind of produce going

886
00:53:13.625 --> 00:53:16.945
to use specifics, then you need to create an environment

887
00:53:16.945 --> 00:53:18.425
to develop that kind of produce.

888
00:53:19.135 --> 00:53:21.745
Okay? In Singapore, they employing that, okay?

889
00:53:22.205 --> 00:53:24.065
So they have this, uh, technology

890
00:53:24.365 --> 00:53:29.205
and employ all of this to create something, uh, that, uh,

891
00:53:29.225 --> 00:53:31.285
the clients will buy, right?

892
00:53:32.395 --> 00:53:33.495
Let me play this video so

893
00:53:33.495 --> 00:53:34.735
that you could see what I'm talking about.

894
00:53:48.575 --> 00:53:50.835
Within the facility, we have got different sensors

895
00:53:50.835 --> 00:53:51.875
that are operating all the time,

896
00:53:51.875 --> 00:53:53.315
24 hours, they all go back to cloud.

897
00:53:53.655 --> 00:53:55.635
So that gives us cont, that gives us data.

898
00:53:55.775 --> 00:53:57.995
And then we are able to look at temperature, humidity,

899
00:53:58.085 --> 00:54:02.755
light levels, CO2 levels, fertilizer, uh, ECPH,

900
00:54:02.895 --> 00:54:05.075
all the different parameters as required for the vegetables.

901
00:54:05.105 --> 00:54:06.155
Grow can be calibrated

902
00:54:37.135 --> 00:54:39.195
As a farmer or as an operator.

903
00:54:39.335 --> 00:54:42.675
You have a lot of information sometimes through checking

904
00:54:42.815 --> 00:54:45.995
and analyzing of the water quality and animal health.

905
00:54:46.255 --> 00:54:49.675
We are trying to create a program, a software that will help

906
00:54:49.935 --> 00:54:52.475
to take all this information from a different sources

907
00:54:52.895 --> 00:54:55.115
and put it together and give you a better picture

908
00:54:55.135 --> 00:54:56.475
of your culture condition.

909
00:55:02.135 --> 00:55:04.915
We have so far not really recovered back our cost

910
00:55:04.915 --> 00:55:05.915
because first of all,

911
00:55:05.935 --> 00:55:08.755
we haven't reached the maximum capacity of production.

912
00:55:08.895 --> 00:55:11.435
And the second, uh, the cost

913
00:55:11.435 --> 00:55:13.635
of doing this business in Singapore is much,

914
00:55:13.635 --> 00:55:15.755
much more higher than any other place.

915
00:55:16.175 --> 00:55:18.115
And for the agriculture

916
00:55:18.115 --> 00:55:20.835
and aquaculture industry, the resources are very limited.

917
00:55:21.015 --> 00:55:23.395
For example, if my pipe broken, I want

918
00:55:23.395 --> 00:55:25.755
to buy certain pipe in Singapore, it's not available.

919
00:55:48.115 --> 00:55:49.955
I am really seeing some startups in Singapore,

920
00:55:49.975 --> 00:55:51.235
in the ugly food tech space.

921
00:55:51.425 --> 00:55:53.875
They are really exporting some

922
00:55:53.875 --> 00:55:56.275
of their technology equipment overseas.

923
00:55:56.775 --> 00:55:59.635
So Singapore is ranked number one in, uh,

924
00:55:59.785 --> 00:56:01.035
food security index.

925
00:56:01.575 --> 00:56:03.355
So when we export something

926
00:56:03.735 --> 00:56:05.355
and it's related to food,

927
00:56:05.875 --> 00:56:07.675
I believe the world would, uh, feel safe.

928
00:56:12.495 --> 00:56:15.795
All right? So from here you can see that, uh,

929
00:56:16.235 --> 00:56:17.995
Singapore is really investing money,

930
00:56:18.485 --> 00:56:22.235
developing new knowledge, uh, in the field of, uh,

931
00:56:22.645 --> 00:56:25.125
let's say food security in general, right?

932
00:56:25.625 --> 00:56:27.365
So why, why they are doing that

933
00:56:27.365 --> 00:56:30.765
because of the impact of climate change.

934
00:56:31.625 --> 00:56:34.245
So in the future, normal farming

935
00:56:34.825 --> 00:56:36.885
may not work anymore.

936
00:56:37.705 --> 00:56:40.525
Why? Because the climate change

937
00:56:42.545 --> 00:56:43.645
is severe.

938
00:56:43.875 --> 00:56:46.565
What do I mean by that? If it is summer, it is too hot.

939
00:56:47.145 --> 00:56:49.445
So your, your crop will not grow there

940
00:56:49.475 --> 00:56:52.965
because of, uh, lack of water, lack

941
00:56:52.965 --> 00:56:55.085
of soil moisture, right?

942
00:56:55.105 --> 00:56:57.085
And then if it is during the rainy season in the

943
00:56:57.085 --> 00:56:59.965
Philippines, so it'll be flood, okay?

944
00:57:00.665 --> 00:57:04.685
So how will you grow crops there in

945
00:57:04.685 --> 00:57:05.765
that kind of setting?

946
00:57:06.665 --> 00:57:10.355
So if you won't do anything,

947
00:57:10.975 --> 00:57:15.155
any solution on that, then it'll create a food

948
00:57:15.705 --> 00:57:17.255
problem, okay?

949
00:57:17.755 --> 00:57:19.175
So if that happen, then

950
00:57:19.175 --> 00:57:21.815
that will be more problematic, chaotic.

951
00:57:22.635 --> 00:57:25.375
So if you are lazy, you will just think,

952
00:57:25.495 --> 00:57:27.095
I will just buy food overseas.

953
00:57:27.095 --> 00:57:30.415
So that is the context of, uh, importing foods.

954
00:57:30.515 --> 00:57:34.455
But the problem there is that we have a lot

955
00:57:34.455 --> 00:57:35.695
of talents in the Philippines,

956
00:57:35.995 --> 00:57:37.655
so we just need to be more creative.

957
00:57:37.955 --> 00:57:41.255
Why not develop a technology that will

958
00:57:41.805 --> 00:57:43.695
address this kind of issues?

959
00:57:43.915 --> 00:57:46.935
So why not develop a technology that would, uh,

960
00:57:47.445 --> 00:57:51.495
what we called a, a climate resilient technology, which is

961
00:57:52.285 --> 00:57:55.895
employing technology so that we could produce food

962
00:57:56.655 --> 00:57:58.735
regardless of the season, right?

963
00:57:59.115 --> 00:58:01.295
So with that, we can ensure the survival

964
00:58:01.995 --> 00:58:04.975
of the Filipino people through food security, right?

965
00:58:05.395 --> 00:58:09.055
So we have to look into that perspective instead of looking,

966
00:58:09.475 --> 00:58:12.295
uh, I will just buy food from other country

967
00:58:12.295 --> 00:58:13.615
because they can produce it,

968
00:58:14.125 --> 00:58:16.455
because in my country, I cannot produce it

969
00:58:16.455 --> 00:58:19.055
because we don't have, uh, a means to do,

970
00:58:19.055 --> 00:58:21.135
because there is a, uh, a

971
00:58:23.155 --> 00:58:25.295
and we cannot do anything about it, so

972
00:58:25.295 --> 00:58:26.655
that it should not be the thinking.

973
00:58:27.075 --> 00:58:30.455
So we should change the way we think by employing technology

974
00:58:30.455 --> 00:58:35.135
to advance, uh, the, uh, the production to ensure

975
00:58:35.165 --> 00:58:39.295
that there is a sustainable food in our country.

976
00:58:40.085 --> 00:58:44.475
Okay? So aside from that, we,

977
00:58:44.475 --> 00:58:46.875
we also need to look into the waste management.

978
00:58:46.935 --> 00:58:49.875
So as I mentioned earlier, when we develop a city,

979
00:58:50.015 --> 00:58:53.315
we develop community, we develop infrastructure, okay?

980
00:58:53.945 --> 00:58:56.915
They, they need all of these resources, they need food,

981
00:58:56.915 --> 00:58:58.595
they need water, et cetera.

982
00:58:58.895 --> 00:59:00.715
But the byproduct of this is the waste.

983
00:59:00.735 --> 00:59:03.515
So we need to have a technology to ensure

984
00:59:03.545 --> 00:59:05.395
that the waste are properly managed.

985
00:59:05.415 --> 00:59:08.035
That's why I'm, I'm telling you earlier, in Singapore,

986
00:59:08.305 --> 00:59:09.995
they manage it through incineration,

987
00:59:10.175 --> 00:59:11.955
but a different type of incineration.

988
00:59:12.455 --> 00:59:15.675
So they burn all of this underground, okay?

989
00:59:15.705 --> 00:59:18.475
They get the heat convert to energy,

990
00:59:18.695 --> 00:59:22.125
and then the solid waste is utilizes in

991
00:59:22.405 --> 00:59:23.925
construction, okay?

992
00:59:24.025 --> 00:59:28.005
So making it more sustainable, okay?

993
00:59:29.825 --> 00:59:33.645
And then also with the this approach.

994
00:59:33.745 --> 00:59:35.805
So we could have, uh, what we call

995
00:59:36.485 --> 00:59:37.605
collaborative research, right?

996
00:59:37.665 --> 00:59:38.725
So what do I mean by that?

997
00:59:39.145 --> 00:59:43.805
So if we do have what we call a platform, okay, a platform,

998
00:59:44.105 --> 00:59:48.285
for example, uh, uh, let's say, uh, a platform,

999
00:59:48.295 --> 00:59:51.725
let's say created by Ian State University, wherein

1000
00:59:52.325 --> 00:59:55.405
researchers from other university

1001
00:59:55.465 --> 01:00:00.005
or even from the industry, can, can, can share their,

1002
01:00:00.465 --> 01:00:03.965
uh, findings, can share their views

1003
01:00:04.385 --> 01:00:06.715
or anything, okay?

1004
01:00:07.285 --> 01:00:11.875
Which encourage other people on the same

1005
01:00:12.195 --> 01:00:14.395
interests to join forces, right?

1006
01:00:14.775 --> 01:00:17.875
And then at the end, they create something like a,

1007
01:00:17.995 --> 01:00:21.155
a new idea, which lead to an innovation,

1008
01:00:21.895 --> 01:00:25.875
and then, uh, which lead to productization, right?

1009
01:00:26.015 --> 01:00:30.475
So then it will have a, a more impact

1010
01:00:31.165 --> 01:00:32.705
to the sustainability

1011
01:00:32.925 --> 01:00:35.785
and the development of our country in general, Deba.

1012
01:00:35.925 --> 01:00:38.745
So that is how efficient collaborative research work

1013
01:00:38.855 --> 01:00:39.905
through technology,

1014
01:00:40.415 --> 01:00:45.145
because individual, uh,

1015
01:00:45.425 --> 01:00:48.585
research, because the more people working on that,

1016
01:00:48.765 --> 01:00:50.345
the more heads are there.

1017
01:00:50.805 --> 01:00:54.985
So it becomes more, uh, relevant

1018
01:00:55.205 --> 01:00:59.025
and more, uh, responsive, okay?

1019
01:00:59.285 --> 01:01:02.745
To the, to the needs of the industry or of the community.

1020
01:01:03.485 --> 01:01:04.665
So that's how it works.

1021
01:01:04.685 --> 01:01:06.985
So if, if it is a, an international context,

1022
01:01:07.165 --> 01:01:08.465
the better, right?

1023
01:01:08.465 --> 01:01:10.425
Because they, they, they can see other things

1024
01:01:10.425 --> 01:01:12.585
that you cannot see, because sometimes your

1025
01:01:12.585 --> 01:01:14.185
perspective is in the Philippines.

1026
01:01:14.185 --> 01:01:16.105
Other people perspective in India

1027
01:01:16.245 --> 01:01:19.225
or in China, in Singapore may compliment each other.

1028
01:01:19.365 --> 01:01:23.545
And then you can create a more, uh, conclusive, okay?

1029
01:01:24.065 --> 01:01:26.425
Findings or research which will benefit more

1030
01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:27.945
the community in general.

1031
01:01:30.945 --> 01:01:33.085
All right? So another application, okay?

1032
01:01:33.085 --> 01:01:35.325
In the field of wellness. So how, for example,

1033
01:01:35.545 --> 01:01:36.805
how well do I sleep?

1034
01:01:36.905 --> 01:01:40.645
So in here, so the technology monitors everything, right?

1035
01:01:40.865 --> 01:01:42.605
The, the way you, you sleep.

1036
01:01:42.625 --> 01:01:46.685
So deep sleep, baan, light sleep, baan, or, uh, whatever.

1037
01:01:46.825 --> 01:01:48.045
So it monitors everything,

1038
01:01:48.465 --> 01:01:50.685
and then all of this information are being safe.

1039
01:01:50.745 --> 01:01:53.925
And then your doctor has a mean to analyze

1040
01:01:53.985 --> 01:01:56.645
and provide you some, uh, intervention

1041
01:01:57.545 --> 01:01:59.445
or some recommendation to,

1042
01:01:59.785 --> 01:02:01.485
to improve the quality of your sleep.

1043
01:02:01.915 --> 01:02:05.115
Okay? So basic approach, okay?

1044
01:02:07.135 --> 01:02:08.515
All right? As we more

1045
01:02:08.535 --> 01:02:11.195
and more engage with technology, so

1046
01:02:11.745 --> 01:02:14.915
sometimes I tell them technology knows

1047
01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:18.475
us more than we do ourself, okay?

1048
01:02:18.475 --> 01:02:19.845
Because technology knows

1049
01:02:20.115 --> 01:02:22.405
that we eat more than the normal, right?

1050
01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:26.405
Because technology know that your, your BP increases,

1051
01:02:26.435 --> 01:02:28.365
your sugar increases, right?

1052
01:02:28.505 --> 01:02:32.855
But ourself, we just ignore it because we don't care, right?

1053
01:02:33.165 --> 01:02:34.375
Okay. Or sometimes we care,

1054
01:02:34.375 --> 01:02:38.175
but we don't have a means to, to to know the figure, right?

1055
01:02:38.515 --> 01:02:40.175
So the technology knows all of this.

1056
01:02:40.175 --> 01:02:41.815
They record it, and then they,

1057
01:02:42.085 --> 01:02:45.215
they provide some analytics, okay?

1058
01:02:45.635 --> 01:02:47.535
And what will be the impact of this

1059
01:02:48.475 --> 01:02:49.935
in the coming weeks or months?

1060
01:02:50.325 --> 01:02:52.335
Because the impact will not be immediate.

1061
01:02:52.355 --> 01:02:54.565
It takes time, okay?

1062
01:02:54.565 --> 01:02:57.645
That's why technology know more us than we do

1063
01:02:57.645 --> 01:02:59.855
ourselves, okay?

1064
01:02:59.885 --> 01:03:03.015
This is the example earlier, the, uh, the applications of,

1065
01:03:03.075 --> 01:03:05.295
uh, smart technology to farming.

1066
01:03:05.675 --> 01:03:06.855
So from here,

1067
01:03:07.355 --> 01:03:10.535
the technology can identify which cattle is pregnant

1068
01:03:10.595 --> 01:03:12.695
or having some diseases,

1069
01:03:12.695 --> 01:03:14.975
then they can do some sort of an isolation.

1070
01:03:15.595 --> 01:03:17.815
So in here, more on preventive, right?

1071
01:03:17.915 --> 01:03:21.835
So instead of responsive, okay, the future.

1072
01:03:22.855 --> 01:03:26.035
So we have here starting at smart home.

1073
01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:29.435
That's why in the university, they teaching smart lab,

1074
01:03:30.085 --> 01:03:33.195
smart, uh, smoke detection, right?

1075
01:03:33.535 --> 01:03:35.795
Uh, all those basic that we improve that.

1076
01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:38.315
So we do have smart grid or smart energy.

1077
01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:41.635
And then later on, when we apply all of this, uh,

1078
01:03:42.375 --> 01:03:44.235
in a more systematic manner,

1079
01:03:44.495 --> 01:03:47.155
it become a smart cities, right?

1080
01:03:47.205 --> 01:03:49.115
Butin, you could manage your food resources,

1081
01:03:49.135 --> 01:03:52.915
energy consumption, waste management and everything, right?

1082
01:03:53.015 --> 01:03:57.115
So all of this in the city and then expanding it more.

1083
01:03:57.655 --> 01:04:01.435
So you, you have another layer wherein it can manufacture

1084
01:04:02.215 --> 01:04:03.595
the resources that you need.

1085
01:04:04.105 --> 01:04:06.155
Okay? So that is the future, okay?

1086
01:04:06.155 --> 01:04:07.995
So hopefully in the Philippines, we do have the same

1087
01:04:08.705 --> 01:04:10.195
direction, okay?

1088
01:04:10.655 --> 01:04:13.835
But of course, with the expert that we have, with the

1089
01:04:14.435 --> 01:04:18.155
talented engineers, IT specialist, okay?

1090
01:04:18.155 --> 01:04:19.195
And domain expert,

1091
01:04:19.935 --> 01:04:23.795
and, uh, fusing all of this with technology, uh, I,

1092
01:04:23.915 --> 01:04:26.675
I believe the Philippines will be able to catch up, okay?

1093
01:04:26.825 --> 01:04:28.795
It's just a matter of, uh, time.

1094
01:04:29.105 --> 01:04:33.235
It's a matter of, uh, uh, change of use. Okay?

1095
01:04:33.855 --> 01:04:35.435
So we need to change our view.

1096
01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:38.675
We need as an engineer, as an IT expert in the future.

1097
01:04:39.455 --> 01:04:43.115
So the thinking must be what solution can we develop

1098
01:04:43.215 --> 01:04:46.595
to address this issue in indeed operating the,

1099
01:04:49.935 --> 01:04:52.715
so you should think of a solution.

1100
01:04:53.075 --> 01:04:56.395
I say as an, as an engineer, as an IT professional,

1101
01:04:56.815 --> 01:05:00.475
we always look for a solution, how we can address this issue

1102
01:05:00.855 --> 01:05:04.715
so that the next generation will have a better future,

1103
01:05:05.195 --> 01:05:08.155
a more, uh, sustainable living.

1104
01:05:08.585 --> 01:05:11.945
Okay? Okay.

1105
01:05:11.945 --> 01:05:15.145
Another area of the Singapore government is, uh,

1106
01:05:15.165 --> 01:05:17.205
in the field of agriculture, okay?

1107
01:05:17.205 --> 01:05:20.165
Then the other one is a aquaculture. Aquaculture is farming.

1108
01:05:20.465 --> 01:05:25.325
It is farming, but, uh, it is farming of aquatic resources.

1109
01:05:25.715 --> 01:05:28.645
Okay? So Singapore is very keen on this

1110
01:05:28.645 --> 01:05:31.325
because this is part of their food security matrix,

1111
01:05:31.915 --> 01:05:33.845
because as I mentioned a while ago,

1112
01:05:34.405 --> 01:05:36.525
Singapore is a small country, okay?

1113
01:05:36.545 --> 01:05:39.525
So they cannot have big farm or they cannot do farming here

1114
01:05:39.595 --> 01:05:41.165
because it's not practical.

1115
01:05:41.275 --> 01:05:45.165
Instead, uh, they, they buy foods from, uh,

1116
01:05:45.935 --> 01:05:47.565
other countries, okay?

1117
01:05:47.865 --> 01:05:50.485
But it is risky because if they have a conflict with

1118
01:05:50.485 --> 01:05:52.845
that country, that country can, can easily,

1119
01:05:52.845 --> 01:05:55.325
it is Sabo at Singapore food supply.

1120
01:05:55.745 --> 01:05:59.525
So that's why Singapore, uh, employ a, uh, some sort of,

1121
01:05:59.545 --> 01:06:00.805
uh, food resiliency.

1122
01:06:01.665 --> 01:06:04.505
So one is importation.

1123
01:06:05.125 --> 01:06:10.065
The second is that, uh, they, uh, rent a,

1124
01:06:10.545 --> 01:06:13.045
a land in a foreign country,

1125
01:06:13.985 --> 01:06:17.125
and then they use that portion of land

1126
01:06:17.665 --> 01:06:19.205
for their food production.

1127
01:06:19.795 --> 01:06:22.485
Okay? So technically they, they do farming there,

1128
01:06:22.865 --> 01:06:24.965
and then all the produce there will

1129
01:06:24.965 --> 01:06:26.245
be returned to Singapore.

1130
01:06:26.955 --> 01:06:28.885
Then the third one, the third, uh,

1131
01:06:29.445 --> 01:06:34.025
approach Singapore doing is to develop this in Singapore.

1132
01:06:34.295 --> 01:06:36.785
Okay? So that's why earlier you see they do have this

1133
01:06:36.785 --> 01:06:38.065
smart agriculture, right?

1134
01:06:38.485 --> 01:06:42.185
So they developing technology, they developing technology,

1135
01:06:42.885 --> 01:06:47.795
uh, to at least add on to the food matrix

1136
01:06:47.815 --> 01:06:51.515
of Singapore, and also to address, uh, climate change.

1137
01:06:52.335 --> 01:06:55.635
And then we have the aquaculture.

1138
01:06:56.135 --> 01:06:59.795
So aquaculture is fish farming species, not only fish,

1139
01:06:59.795 --> 01:07:03.315
but all, uh, food, okay?

1140
01:07:03.505 --> 01:07:06.195
From the, uh, the water. Okay?

1141
01:07:06.695 --> 01:07:08.915
So Singapore is spending money on that

1142
01:07:08.955 --> 01:07:11.555
because they believe that if they develop this, uh,

1143
01:07:12.125 --> 01:07:15.955
technology, they, they at least augment 2% of their need.

1144
01:07:16.265 --> 01:07:19.235
Okay? Also in Singapore, they have this, uh, one

1145
01:07:19.905 --> 01:07:21.275
company, I forget the name.

1146
01:07:21.495 --> 01:07:25.115
Uh, they have this, uh, uh, eight story building.

1147
01:07:25.705 --> 01:07:29.275
Then, uh, that eight story building is a, a farm.

1148
01:07:29.905 --> 01:07:33.595
What they do, they farm there is fish imagina, some building

1149
01:07:34.165 --> 01:07:36.475
eight story, eight floor building per, is

1150
01:07:36.475 --> 01:07:38.315
that why they do that?

1151
01:07:38.505 --> 01:07:41.795
Because they know if they have this technology,

1152
01:07:42.165 --> 01:07:46.715
it'll help them to, to be more food resilient, okay?

1153
01:07:46.735 --> 01:07:48.195
And add onto the food matrix.

1154
01:07:48.775 --> 01:07:50.435
So that's how they look into the future.

1155
01:07:50.495 --> 01:07:52.995
But in the Philippines, you cannot see that because of illa.

1156
01:07:53.105 --> 01:07:54.355
They have a big sea there.

1157
01:07:54.775 --> 01:07:56.475
But what if there is a climate change?

1158
01:07:56.475 --> 01:07:58.635
Temperature rises, all the fish go out,

1159
01:07:58.785 --> 01:08:00.835
meaning go more north.

1160
01:08:03.575 --> 01:08:06.675
Is that so what will happen die,

1161
01:08:06.895 --> 01:08:09.115
but in Singapore, they look on the solution.

1162
01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:11.715
Okay? So let me play this video so that you can see

1163
01:08:11.775 --> 01:08:14.355
how Singapore look into this direction

1164
01:08:15.405 --> 01:08:18.385
Is ramping up efforts to advance the country's nascent

1165
01:08:18.385 --> 01:08:19.585
to aquaculture sector.

1166
01:08:19.965 --> 01:08:23.265
And the aim is to help local farmers breed stronger lines

1167
01:08:23.325 --> 01:08:25.425
of fish and fund programs

1168
01:08:25.445 --> 01:08:27.665
to better monitor water conditions.

1169
01:08:28.005 --> 01:08:31.105
The city state is looking to Australia's best practices

1170
01:08:31.325 --> 01:08:32.825
to glean some insights.

1171
01:08:32.925 --> 01:08:35.505
And Chloe Chu reports from Perth, Australia.

1172
01:08:38.455 --> 01:08:40.825
It's the land of pristine coastlines

1173
01:08:42.125 --> 01:08:44.025
and thriving marine biodiversity.

1174
01:08:47.375 --> 01:08:49.905
This is a vastly different landscape from Singapore's,

1175
01:08:50.245 --> 01:08:52.745
but under the surface lies important

1176
01:08:52.745 --> 01:08:54.265
lessons for the island nation.

1177
01:08:55.055 --> 01:08:57.225
Good animal husbandry is actually a very key

1178
01:08:57.245 --> 01:09:00.465
and crucial part of their, uh, sustainable operations.

1179
01:09:01.275 --> 01:09:02.545
Among challenges faced

1180
01:09:02.565 --> 01:09:05.825
by the republic's fledgling agriculture sector is the high

1181
01:09:05.855 --> 01:09:09.385
fish stock mortality rate senior minister of state

1182
01:09:09.405 --> 01:09:11.145
for sustainability in the environment.

1183
01:09:11.415 --> 01:09:14.265
Copo Kun says some traditional fish farms in Singapore

1184
01:09:14.445 --> 01:09:16.745
report a rate as high as 70%,

1185
01:09:17.645 --> 01:09:19.025
And that is very, very high number.

1186
01:09:19.025 --> 01:09:21.545
Whereas compared to many of the Australian farms here,

1187
01:09:21.545 --> 01:09:23.185
which has good husbandry practices,

1188
01:09:23.435 --> 01:09:24.985
their stock losses are typically in

1189
01:09:24.985 --> 01:09:26.065
the range of 10% or less.

1190
01:09:26.645 --> 01:09:28.105
And I think it, it speaks to the,

1191
01:09:28.105 --> 01:09:29.505
how the business itself needs

1192
01:09:29.505 --> 01:09:31.865
to actually adopt a science-based approach

1193
01:09:31.865 --> 01:09:32.945
to animal husbandry.

1194
01:09:33.285 --> 01:09:35.785
Not just to be giving welfare to the animals

1195
01:09:35.785 --> 01:09:37.705
that they are growing, but also to make sure

1196
01:09:37.705 --> 01:09:39.665
that they preserve their stock capacity.

1197
01:09:40.365 --> 01:09:42.625
So, as I say, prevention is better than cure.

1198
01:09:43.495 --> 01:09:44.665
It's challenges like this

1199
01:09:44.775 --> 01:09:47.585
that brought government officials, business people,

1200
01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:50.665
and members of the press from Singapore to both Southern

1201
01:09:50.725 --> 01:09:51.745
and Western Australia.

1202
01:09:52.865 --> 01:09:55.145
Singapore is looking to its veterinary science experts

1203
01:09:55.285 --> 01:09:58.025
to equip local farms with the technical tools

1204
01:09:58.485 --> 01:10:00.705
to adopt better fish keeping practices.

1205
01:10:01.765 --> 01:10:03.345
The island state is also studying

1206
01:10:03.485 --> 01:10:07.265
how Australia uses a nutrient budget to strike a balance

1207
01:10:07.375 --> 01:10:09.625
between nutrient content and fish health.

1208
01:10:10.135 --> 01:10:11.785
What they have consistently point out is

1209
01:10:11.785 --> 01:10:13.905
that if there are too much dissolved nutrients in the water,

1210
01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:15.145
it can lead to problems

1211
01:10:15.145 --> 01:10:18.185
because it means that the harmful algaes can also grow in

1212
01:10:18.185 --> 01:10:20.465
there, and that itself can then threaten the fish stock

1213
01:10:20.465 --> 01:10:23.385
by lowering the oxygen content in the water in order

1214
01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:25.305
to make sure this whole body of water is sustainable.

1215
01:10:25.415 --> 01:10:28.025
Farmers ought to be conscious about how much fish they put

1216
01:10:28.025 --> 01:10:30.185
inside, but also how they feed the fish.

1217
01:10:31.165 --> 01:10:33.905
And because one farmer's feeding practices can affect

1218
01:10:33.905 --> 01:10:35.465
another, sharing the same body

1219
01:10:35.465 --> 01:10:38.745
of water legislation may be considered to manage this

1220
01:10:38.965 --> 01:10:40.185
and level the playing field.

1221
01:10:41.155 --> 01:10:42.705
Given today's nascent sector,

1222
01:10:43.365 --> 01:10:47.225
if we do not have some regulations to guide a proper use

1223
01:10:47.245 --> 01:10:50.585
of feeding and stocking, it may be difficult

1224
01:10:50.585 --> 01:10:52.505
for the industry themselves to self-regulate.

1225
01:10:52.805 --> 01:10:54.785
So we will have to think about whether we want

1226
01:10:54.785 --> 01:10:57.905
to put some enabling legislation as a form of guide

1227
01:10:57.905 --> 01:11:00.185
to the industry to develop themselves sustainably

1228
01:11:00.725 --> 01:11:03.785
As Singapore ramps up production of locally grown food.

1229
01:11:04.125 --> 01:11:07.065
Dr. Cole says the country will look closer at funding,

1230
01:11:07.075 --> 01:11:09.065
water monitoring something the

1231
01:11:09.065 --> 01:11:10.705
Australians pride themselves in.

1232
01:11:11.525 --> 01:11:12.585
One of the things we learned here is

1233
01:11:12.585 --> 01:11:14.525
that they do undertake a more comprehensive set

1234
01:11:14.525 --> 01:11:17.605
of monitoring of water quality, including dissolved nitrogen

1235
01:11:18.165 --> 01:11:20.565
nutrients, and maybe even other form of parameters.

1236
01:11:21.065 --> 01:11:23.005
So we will undertake this study with many

1237
01:11:23.005 --> 01:11:24.565
of our technical agencies that incorporate

1238
01:11:24.565 --> 01:11:25.685
what the academics

1239
01:11:25.685 --> 01:11:27.405
and the scientific community can bring on board as well

1240
01:11:27.785 --> 01:11:30.765
to see how we can roll out a, a more comprehensive series

1241
01:11:30.785 --> 01:11:32.005
of monitoring regime.

1242
01:11:33.065 --> 01:11:36.125
He says, this is where industry players in academia can

1243
01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:37.925
work with the government, which could provide

1244
01:11:37.995 --> 01:11:39.085
some enabling grants.

1245
01:11:40.265 --> 01:11:43.085
The trip organized by the Singapore food Agency comes

1246
01:11:43.085 --> 01:11:45.565
as the nation is working to strengthen its food security

1247
01:11:46.105 --> 01:11:49.525
by producing 30% of its food locally by 2030.

1248
01:11:50.415 --> 01:11:52.325
Chloe, true CNA per.

1249
01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:55.125
Alright? So you see from the video, technically

1250
01:11:55.195 --> 01:11:58.845
what Singapore wants is to, to provide some sort

1251
01:11:58.845 --> 01:12:02.925
of resiliency, uh, so that they can have, uh,

1252
01:12:03.035 --> 01:12:04.645
food grown, okay?

1253
01:12:04.745 --> 01:12:07.045
In, in Singapore soil, right?

1254
01:12:07.045 --> 01:12:11.565
Because they know, uh, relying on import is not sustainable.

1255
01:12:12.485 --> 01:12:13.855
Okay? So that is one.

1256
01:12:14.115 --> 01:12:16.895
And then also learning from the other countries

1257
01:12:16.895 --> 01:12:21.415
who have expertise of this will help them to, to take the,

1258
01:12:21.555 --> 01:12:26.175
uh, the role of, uh, rearing all of this, uh,

1259
01:12:27.245 --> 01:12:29.855
species in Singapore soil, okay?

1260
01:12:29.915 --> 01:12:33.335
By monitoring expansion, the water quality parameters,

1261
01:12:33.435 --> 01:12:37.535
the impact to the survivability of the, the species,

1262
01:12:37.675 --> 01:12:39.295
the fish, the algae and everything.

1263
01:12:39.875 --> 01:12:43.015
So it, it, it implicates the, the growth, okay?

1264
01:12:43.075 --> 01:12:45.815
The harvest in general, right?

1265
01:12:45.815 --> 01:12:49.215
So with, with all of this, uh, they able to,

1266
01:12:49.315 --> 01:12:53.695
to develop a more resilient, uh, aquaculture, okay?

1267
01:12:53.835 --> 01:12:57.955
In Singapore, all right?

1268
01:12:58.015 --> 01:13:02.315
So this is, uh, just an overview of this as, uh, based on

1269
01:13:02.315 --> 01:13:03.515
what I have presented earlier.

1270
01:13:04.455 --> 01:13:07.155
So smart technology.

1271
01:13:07.415 --> 01:13:09.755
So the backbone of this is the sensing.

1272
01:13:10.585 --> 01:13:13.915
Then you have the, uh, embedded solution,

1273
01:13:14.815 --> 01:13:19.555
and then you also have the, uh, the software itself, okay?

1274
01:13:19.695 --> 01:13:23.915
And then the software is the one that, uh, enabling

1275
01:13:24.175 --> 01:13:27.515
or enabling technology for all of those application

1276
01:13:27.515 --> 01:13:28.555
because without the software,

1277
01:13:29.055 --> 01:13:30.515
so your hardware will not work.

1278
01:13:30.535 --> 01:13:31.915
So that's why it is an enabling.

1279
01:13:31.935 --> 01:13:35.435
So which develops these area specific application

1280
01:13:35.655 --> 01:13:37.235
for smart technology.

1281
01:13:37.235 --> 01:13:41.715
That's why you have here smart lighting, smart cars, smart

1282
01:13:42.345 --> 01:13:46.395
tagging, smart health, smart infrastructure, all

1283
01:13:46.395 --> 01:13:50.075
of these smart you will see hardware involvement,

1284
01:13:50.135 --> 01:13:54.355
but also it needs the backbone of the software

1285
01:13:54.495 --> 01:13:55.755
to make them more intelligent.

1286
01:13:55.755 --> 01:13:58.395
Because without software, they cannot be intelligent.

1287
01:13:58.455 --> 01:14:00.915
So that's why the future is a more

1288
01:14:01.575 --> 01:14:04.195
multidisciplinary in nature, right?

1289
01:14:04.215 --> 01:14:06.515
So that's why when you take up a course in agriculture,

1290
01:14:06.585 --> 01:14:08.795
it's a traditional agriculture already

1291
01:14:09.065 --> 01:14:11.525
because you have here smart agriculture.

1292
01:14:11.625 --> 01:14:15.765
So you have ha to have an idea of technology, how

1293
01:14:15.825 --> 01:14:18.645
to make agriculture more relevant

1294
01:14:18.745 --> 01:14:20.405
and responsive to the needs

1295
01:14:20.505 --> 01:14:22.965
of the current generation, right?

1296
01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:25.005
So that is how it'll go in the future.

1297
01:14:25.335 --> 01:14:27.205
Later on, I will give you some insight

1298
01:14:27.205 --> 01:14:28.245
of the future of jobs.

1299
01:14:31.165 --> 01:14:34.945
So smart technology or the iot enabling technology.

1300
01:14:35.005 --> 01:14:38.465
So you have identification through the use of the sensors

1301
01:14:38.485 --> 01:14:40.145
and you need communication lines

1302
01:14:40.285 --> 01:14:44.025
or systems to transmit that data from one point to another,

1303
01:14:45.345 --> 01:14:48.725
and then once it reach the computing capability

1304
01:14:48.785 --> 01:14:52.565
or the computing storage, so they will do an analysis

1305
01:14:53.065 --> 01:14:57.445
and then this analysis create what we call, uh, a services

1306
01:14:58.145 --> 01:15:01.525
and, uh, can be used to do some sort

1307
01:15:01.525 --> 01:15:03.165
of a prediction, right?

1308
01:15:03.375 --> 01:15:05.325
Which are in the form of semantic

1309
01:15:05.905 --> 01:15:09.285
or can be lead to a new knowledge

1310
01:15:09.345 --> 01:15:11.245
or new field of specialization.

1311
01:15:12.005 --> 01:15:13.495
Okay? So that's why iot

1312
01:15:13.515 --> 01:15:17.335
or smart system is developing new fields, right?

1313
01:15:17.545 --> 01:15:21.835
Developing new, uh, new industry.

1314
01:15:22.505 --> 01:15:24.475
Okay? Then who would imagine

1315
01:15:24.475 --> 01:15:26.515
that data science will become a science

1316
01:15:26.605 --> 01:15:29.395
where in fact data is just a raw right?

1317
01:15:29.535 --> 01:15:31.875
And science is an organized knowledge.

1318
01:15:32.295 --> 01:15:35.035
So how a raw material become an organized knowledge.

1319
01:15:35.035 --> 01:15:39.235
So we don't know, but as we progress, so it becomes

1320
01:15:39.895 --> 01:15:41.795
an organized field.

1321
01:15:42.015 --> 01:15:44.395
So that's why they call it a data science nowadays,

1322
01:15:44.545 --> 01:15:47.475
because they develop something new that they get an,

1323
01:15:47.615 --> 01:15:50.995
an insight which develop more innovations

1324
01:15:50.995 --> 01:15:52.075
that we have nowadays.

1325
01:15:54.295 --> 01:15:56.345
Okay? And then these are just, uh,

1326
01:15:56.345 --> 01:16:00.305
historical information about, uh, the, uh, IO ot,

1327
01:16:00.805 --> 01:16:03.065
uh, figures.

1328
01:16:03.565 --> 01:16:07.945
So this figure shows that in 2003, okay?

1329
01:16:08.485 --> 01:16:12.675
So the IO OT is just 0.5 billion, okay?

1330
01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:16.275
As compared with the human population in 2 0 0 3,

1331
01:16:16.925 --> 01:16:19.835
human population, they say 6.3 billion,

1332
01:16:20.735 --> 01:16:23.755
and then IOT devices is 0.5 billion.

1333
01:16:24.935 --> 01:16:28.355
Now moving forward in 2020, which is four years ago,

1334
01:16:29.005 --> 01:16:31.795
human population is 7.6 billion,

1335
01:16:32.535 --> 01:16:36.155
but I OT devices, is there 50 billion.

1336
01:16:36.775 --> 01:16:39.435
So imagine how many devices we have per person.

1337
01:16:40.095 --> 01:16:44.725
So that was the data in 2020. Okay?

1338
01:16:45.635 --> 01:16:48.295
So technically the saying is that, uh,

1339
01:16:49.185 --> 01:16:51.975
there are more connected device than people.

1340
01:16:52.355 --> 01:16:55.865
So there are more gadget, okay? Than new man.

1341
01:16:56.165 --> 01:17:00.505
So that's why in the future, so you have to, to,

1342
01:17:00.525 --> 01:17:03.025
to anticipate that technology

1343
01:17:03.525 --> 01:17:08.065
or all of these, uh, uh, machines, okay?

1344
01:17:08.405 --> 01:17:10.285
Uh, more present

1345
01:17:11.375 --> 01:17:14.705
than us human in other places, okay?

1346
01:17:14.705 --> 01:17:18.425
That's why there, there is a, uh, a discussion saying that,

1347
01:17:18.485 --> 01:17:20.865
uh, with all of this development in technology,

1348
01:17:21.685 --> 01:17:24.065
AI will displace us human, okay?

1349
01:17:24.175 --> 01:17:28.385
Because there are so predominant in value in other fields.

1350
01:17:29.285 --> 01:17:32.905
So I, my opinion here is that AI will be there,

1351
01:17:33.175 --> 01:17:36.385
this technology will be there to complement us

1352
01:17:37.005 --> 01:17:38.145
and not to replace us.

1353
01:17:38.605 --> 01:17:41.225
So we, we need a strong regulations on the use

1354
01:17:41.225 --> 01:17:44.585
of this technology to ensure that they are

1355
01:17:45.215 --> 01:17:47.305
complementing our limitation,

1356
01:17:48.165 --> 01:17:51.665
and still, they are still what we call human in the loop.

1357
01:17:51.665 --> 01:17:53.865
Because if we remove human in the loop

1358
01:17:54.125 --> 01:17:57.745
and AI become more, uh, supreme than us, then

1359
01:17:57.745 --> 01:17:59.665
that will be the start of our extinction,

1360
01:18:00.035 --> 01:18:02.945
which I believe we don't want to happen, okay?

1361
01:18:04.925 --> 01:18:09.655
Alright. Aside from that, as we become more integrated

1362
01:18:09.655 --> 01:18:14.055
with technology, as we become more engaged with this,

1363
01:18:14.435 --> 01:18:16.935
so there is another area that we need to look on

1364
01:18:17.515 --> 01:18:19.695
the security and privacy, okay?

1365
01:18:20.235 --> 01:18:22.135
So engineers

1366
01:18:22.135 --> 01:18:25.445
and scientists must be, uh, able

1367
01:18:25.625 --> 01:18:30.285
to incorporate security in all aspect of their development.

1368
01:18:30.385 --> 01:18:33.805
In the early days. They put security on the last, okay?

1369
01:18:33.805 --> 01:18:35.205
They say, I developed the system

1370
01:18:35.205 --> 01:18:36.605
that I will consider security,

1371
01:18:37.265 --> 01:18:41.325
but nowadays you have to include security before, okay?

1372
01:18:41.345 --> 01:18:45.485
The development. And it should be implemented in all stages

1373
01:18:45.825 --> 01:18:46.845
of development.

1374
01:18:47.075 --> 01:18:49.485
Because once you miss this

1375
01:18:49.665 --> 01:18:51.245
and something happened to your system

1376
01:18:52.025 --> 01:18:55.285
and the the overall system is compromised, then

1377
01:18:55.285 --> 01:18:58.805
that would be a very big issue, okay?

1378
01:18:59.705 --> 01:19:03.685
So you have to look into the resiliency of your system,

1379
01:19:04.305 --> 01:19:06.965
and then you have to include proper data authentication,

1380
01:19:07.705 --> 01:19:10.205
and then you have to limit who can access the system,

1381
01:19:10.905 --> 01:19:15.405
and then you have to ensure the privacy of the client, okay?

1382
01:19:15.405 --> 01:19:17.445
And then the future prospect, okay?

1383
01:19:17.585 --> 01:19:20.005
In terms of, uh, this technology.

1384
01:19:20.985 --> 01:19:24.725
So marketing iot represents a tremendous opportunity

1385
01:19:24.905 --> 01:19:26.205
for various companies.

1386
01:19:27.065 --> 01:19:29.205
And then, uh, based on the technology

1387
01:19:29.225 --> 01:19:31.125
and services, so there are more

1388
01:19:31.185 --> 01:19:36.045
and more company will be, uh, engaged into this technology,

1389
01:19:36.045 --> 01:19:40.645
whether you are in the energy sector, food security,

1390
01:19:41.275 --> 01:19:45.485
agriculture, uh, building, infrastructure,

1391
01:19:45.855 --> 01:19:48.925
healthcare, they will all engage into this

1392
01:19:48.925 --> 01:19:50.325
because they see the benefits

1393
01:19:50.745 --> 01:19:53.405
and the advantage of this technology in their respective

1394
01:19:53.885 --> 01:19:57.845
services that they may provide to the clients, okay?

1395
01:19:58.545 --> 01:20:00.925
And the number of connected devices will be

1396
01:20:01.695 --> 01:20:03.005
still growing, okay?

1397
01:20:05.145 --> 01:20:08.365
Uh, the, uh, number of devices is, uh,

1398
01:20:09.085 --> 01:20:10.165
enormous, okay?

1399
01:20:10.755 --> 01:20:14.545
From the current population, okay?

1400
01:20:14.605 --> 01:20:19.315
So that is how technology will be moving on in the future.

1401
01:20:19.505 --> 01:20:22.395
Therefore, uh, some countries

1402
01:20:22.925 --> 01:20:25.355
leveraging on this will be more and more smart.

1403
01:20:25.775 --> 01:20:30.355
So that's why we, we need to ensure that we able to

1404
01:20:30.985 --> 01:20:33.115
address that gap, okay?

1405
01:20:33.115 --> 01:20:36.435
Especially in the Philippines, we cannot stay as

1406
01:20:36.435 --> 01:20:37.835
what it is currently.

1407
01:20:38.015 --> 01:20:39.995
We have to change, okay?

1408
01:20:39.995 --> 01:20:42.995
That's why you see why other country are, uh,

1409
01:20:43.025 --> 01:20:47.235
advancing more than we can do because of the mindset, right?

1410
01:20:47.575 --> 01:20:51.095
So we have to change the mindset, all right?

1411
01:20:51.115 --> 01:20:53.935
So this is just an historical data just for you

1412
01:20:54.035 --> 01:20:57.795
to see the growth of the technology, right?

1413
01:20:57.855 --> 01:21:01.715
So the internet users in billion, okay?

1414
01:21:01.815 --> 01:21:06.165
And then, uh, prominent companies employing, uh,

1415
01:21:06.375 --> 01:21:10.365
smart system, including artificial intelligence, uh,

1416
01:21:10.785 --> 01:21:12.205
and intelligence system.

1417
01:21:12.715 --> 01:21:17.665
Okay? So internet of everything will be there, okay?

1418
01:21:17.685 --> 01:21:22.585
In the next 50 or even a hundred years, okay?

1419
01:21:22.605 --> 01:21:26.505
It just varies on their, uh, levels of engagement.

1420
01:21:28.055 --> 01:21:31.595
Okay? So the number of devices will be, uh,

1421
01:21:31.895 --> 01:21:33.315
triple, okay?

1422
01:21:33.385 --> 01:21:35.475
They, they projected that, uh,

1423
01:21:36.655 --> 01:21:39.475
in 2025, okay?

1424
01:21:39.695 --> 01:21:43.355
So there will be 200 billion of units, okay?

1425
01:21:44.025 --> 01:21:45.755
From Intel alone, okay?

1426
01:21:45.755 --> 01:21:49.195
And then for IDC, there are 212 billion units.

1427
01:21:50.055 --> 01:21:51.915
So add up all of those technology.

1428
01:21:52.225 --> 01:21:57.195
They will outnumbered us human in the planet, okay?

1429
01:21:57.195 --> 01:22:00.675
Another opportunity to look into that is to how to

1430
01:22:01.735 --> 01:22:04.515
manage all of this technology waste.

1431
01:22:05.185 --> 01:22:07.475
Okay? So you have to look on that, yeah.

1432
01:22:07.475 --> 01:22:10.795
Because it is an opportunity for us to, to, uh,

1433
01:22:11.515 --> 01:22:13.205
leverage on, okay?

1434
01:22:13.665 --> 01:22:15.845
So the growth of things, uh, just again,

1435
01:22:15.865 --> 01:22:19.125
you see the blue one number of human or people on earth,

1436
01:22:20.415 --> 01:22:23.235
or sorry, the yellow one is the people on earth.

1437
01:22:23.235 --> 01:22:25.555
Then the blue one is the iot or the technology.

1438
01:22:26.255 --> 01:22:29.835
Now it keep changing. Okay? So moving on.

1439
01:22:29.975 --> 01:22:33.995
So 2020, the billion, okay? 50 billion of things.

1440
01:22:34.335 --> 01:22:37.355
So that's why I say there are more things than us, okay?

1441
01:22:37.355 --> 01:22:40.785
Than you one, right?

1442
01:22:41.005 --> 01:22:45.925
So this is the pyramid that I want to share

1443
01:22:45.925 --> 01:22:48.285
to you also as we progress

1444
01:22:48.935 --> 01:22:50.925
human civilization, you see here.

1445
01:22:51.465 --> 01:22:54.445
So the data are, as I mentioned, raw, very low,

1446
01:22:54.445 --> 01:22:55.685
so meaning less important,

1447
01:22:56.265 --> 01:22:59.965
but as you organize them, it becomes an information.

1448
01:23:00.545 --> 01:23:03.085
And if this organized information able

1449
01:23:03.105 --> 01:23:06.885
to address certain question, it becomes knowledge.

1450
01:23:07.345 --> 01:23:11.965
And if this knowledge creates what we call, uh, an insight,

1451
01:23:12.105 --> 01:23:13.605
it becomes an understanding.

1452
01:23:14.145 --> 01:23:16.645
And if this understanding become an organized

1453
01:23:16.645 --> 01:23:17.845
field, it become a wisdom.

1454
01:23:18.635 --> 01:23:20.645
Okay? So that is how, uh, they,

1455
01:23:20.835 --> 01:23:24.045
they say the new oil is the data, right?

1456
01:23:24.045 --> 01:23:25.525
Because it develops a new field,

1457
01:23:25.545 --> 01:23:29.285
it develops a new understanding, a new wisdom, a new field

1458
01:23:29.285 --> 01:23:32.765
of specialization that will help human civilization

1459
01:23:33.425 --> 01:23:37.535
to progress in the coming years, right?

1460
01:23:37.555 --> 01:23:39.535
And then for the future of jobs, so I already finished

1461
01:23:39.535 --> 01:23:41.055
with the, the smart system.

1462
01:23:41.595 --> 01:23:44.455
So as we move on, okay?

1463
01:23:44.455 --> 01:23:47.095
With all of these changes in technology adoption,

1464
01:23:47.095 --> 01:23:48.215
technology fusion.

1465
01:23:49.035 --> 01:23:52.415
So we need to develop a, a resource,

1466
01:23:53.095 --> 01:23:55.375
a human resource, or a talent

1467
01:23:55.875 --> 01:23:58.935
or an expert professionals in those fields.

1468
01:23:59.995 --> 01:24:02.855
So the future will also change.

1469
01:24:03.555 --> 01:24:07.215
So the traditional field, such as, for example, you are a,

1470
01:24:08.755 --> 01:24:12.535
uh, a person working in the traditional

1471
01:24:12.645 --> 01:24:14.015
marketing, okay?

1472
01:24:14.015 --> 01:24:16.495
Wherein you are using the traditional approach in the

1473
01:24:16.495 --> 01:24:19.875
future, this field will come.

1474
01:24:20.295 --> 01:24:23.235
Why? Because of the introduction of digital marketing

1475
01:24:23.735 --> 01:24:26.915
and introductions of, uh, intelligence solution, right?

1476
01:24:27.575 --> 01:24:32.275
So you, uh, usage

1477
01:24:32.415 --> 01:24:34.835
of large language model to to, to,

1478
01:24:35.455 --> 01:24:37.525
to develop new insight.

1479
01:24:37.875 --> 01:24:41.405
Okay? So, so you don't need those traditional activities

1480
01:24:41.405 --> 01:24:44.805
because systems or the AI will do that for you, Eva.

1481
01:24:44.865 --> 01:24:46.885
So we, we need to reinvent ourself.

1482
01:24:47.265 --> 01:24:50.645
So as the, the industry change, there are also needs

1483
01:24:51.225 --> 01:24:52.445
for those new roles.

1484
01:24:52.955 --> 01:24:57.685
Okay? So you need data engineer, data scientists, eva, ai,

1485
01:24:58.025 --> 01:24:59.565
uh, professional.

1486
01:25:00.065 --> 01:25:03.405
And then civil engineers may also change some of their,

1487
01:25:04.145 --> 01:25:05.485
uh, area.

1488
01:25:05.785 --> 01:25:09.005
So they may include ing, smart building,

1489
01:25:11.595 --> 01:25:15.605
twin, twin tower concept, the bio simulation,

1490
01:25:16.215 --> 01:25:19.645
which will help them to be more responsive than the need

1491
01:25:19.705 --> 01:25:22.285
of the, the specific fields

1492
01:25:22.285 --> 01:25:23.725
that they have or of the industry.

1493
01:25:24.305 --> 01:25:27.165
So there are so many new things are coming,

1494
01:25:27.305 --> 01:25:30.885
so promising and changes.

1495
01:25:31.285 --> 01:25:34.765
Although in ma trabajo, per, they, they need to catch up.

1496
01:25:35.325 --> 01:25:37.485
'cause that is how industrial revolution works.

1497
01:25:40.875 --> 01:25:44.485
Most of the time. The changes provides more opportunity,

1498
01:25:44.765 --> 01:25:48.645
provides more, uh, incentives, okay?

1499
01:25:48.665 --> 01:25:51.325
To the current and to the future generation.

1500
01:25:54.145 --> 01:25:58.765
All right? So how does the future of jobs looks like?

1501
01:25:59.235 --> 01:26:01.365
Okay? So I have here a short video

1502
01:26:01.745 --> 01:26:04.125
how the work would look like in 2030.

1503
01:26:05.025 --> 01:26:08.205
So in here, you will see how AI will become part

1504
01:26:08.205 --> 01:26:12.245
of our system, how virtual reality,

1505
01:26:12.395 --> 01:26:16.725
augmented reality will help us in, in some

1506
01:26:16.725 --> 01:26:21.365
of the industries in terms of, uh, user experience, in terms

1507
01:26:21.705 --> 01:26:26.185
of, uh, uh, insight development.

1508
01:26:26.695 --> 01:26:29.065
Okay? So you can see from here, okay?

1509
01:26:29.065 --> 01:26:32.505
So let me play this video so that you can see what the,

1510
01:26:32.525 --> 01:26:36.465
the work okay in 20 20, 20 30 would look like.

1511
01:26:43.395 --> 01:26:46.255
The world will look very different by 2030

1512
01:26:48.155 --> 01:26:50.615
in a new report tech in 2030,

1513
01:26:51.275 --> 01:26:53.455
global data looks at the future of work

1514
01:26:53.715 --> 01:26:56.695
and finds disruptive technologies

1515
01:26:56.835 --> 01:26:59.975
and social movements will transform the future of work

1516
01:27:01.075 --> 01:27:04.655
by 2030, the four day work week will be widespread,

1517
01:27:04.955 --> 01:27:06.095
but not ubiquitous.

1518
01:27:07.825 --> 01:27:10.455
Calls for a four day work week have strengthened

1519
01:27:10.515 --> 01:27:11.615
in the last two years.

1520
01:27:12.965 --> 01:27:16.335
This shift will be led by companies rather than governments

1521
01:27:16.715 --> 01:27:18.015
as they compete for talent.

1522
01:27:19.145 --> 01:27:22.175
Automation will support but not displace jobs.

1523
01:27:23.135 --> 01:27:25.695
Artificial intelligence and robotics are the technologies

1524
01:27:25.725 --> 01:27:27.135
that will drive automation.

1525
01:27:27.755 --> 01:27:30.335
The trend is clear. In the next few years,

1526
01:27:30.725 --> 01:27:32.815
even the most senior roles will employ

1527
01:27:32.815 --> 01:27:34.655
technological augmentation.

1528
01:27:35.555 --> 01:27:39.575
By 20, 30 few jobs will have been fully displaced

1529
01:27:39.575 --> 01:27:42.975
by technology, but a new class of jobs will have emerged.

1530
01:27:43.465 --> 01:27:44.775
Those required to manage

1531
01:27:44.835 --> 01:27:46.895
and oversee automation technology,

1532
01:27:47.885 --> 01:27:51.055
potential job titles include robot handler

1533
01:27:51.075 --> 01:27:55.455
or AI director offices will move into the metaverse

1534
01:27:56.315 --> 01:28:00.735
ar vr, digital twins, ai 5G

1535
01:28:01.495 --> 01:28:04.615
collaboration tools and wearable tech will drive the shift.

1536
01:28:05.045 --> 01:28:08.015
Metaverse workspaces will allow socialization

1537
01:28:08.015 --> 01:28:10.135
with colleagues, project collaboration

1538
01:28:10.715 --> 01:28:13.575
and gamified learning activities while working from

1539
01:28:13.575 --> 01:28:16.015
home in 2030.

1540
01:28:16.395 --> 01:28:18.855
The world and its people won't be the same.

1541
01:28:24.485 --> 01:28:26.655
Alright? So you see from the, the video.

1542
01:28:27.315 --> 01:28:31.975
So the future of jobs by 2030 as,

1543
01:28:32.275 --> 01:28:36.615
uh, uh, presented here will be different, okay?

1544
01:28:36.765 --> 01:28:40.535
Because they employ technology in various sector

1545
01:28:41.195 --> 01:28:44.415
of the industry, and mostly seniors in that time

1546
01:28:44.995 --> 01:28:48.175
are those current middle managers that we have now.

1547
01:28:48.595 --> 01:28:52.375
So they will become more technology savvy, more, uh,

1548
01:28:52.375 --> 01:28:55.215
technology dependent, uh, professionals.

1549
01:28:55.755 --> 01:28:58.375
So that's why, uh, the future will be more

1550
01:28:58.375 --> 01:28:59.855
different from what we have now.

1551
01:29:00.445 --> 01:29:04.405
Okay? All right.

1552
01:29:04.585 --> 01:29:08.925
So as I mentioned, new jobs will be developed, okay?

1553
01:29:09.155 --> 01:29:10.885
Replacing those olds

1554
01:29:11.155 --> 01:29:13.525
that are not anymore relevant to society.

1555
01:29:14.025 --> 01:29:17.445
So that's why my advice here to the younger generations,

1556
01:29:17.505 --> 01:29:21.565
to the future, engineers, architects, urban planner,

1557
01:29:21.725 --> 01:29:23.765
technologies, agriculturalists,

1558
01:29:23.785 --> 01:29:26.805
and all other fields, reinvent yourself.

1559
01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:31.125
Okay? So reinvent yourself and make yourself relevant

1560
01:29:31.185 --> 01:29:33.085
and competitive to the industry.

1561
01:29:33.715 --> 01:29:35.645
Look beyond the Philippine shore.

1562
01:29:36.385 --> 01:29:40.125
See what the need, the, the future needs. Okay?

1563
01:29:40.225 --> 01:29:42.845
So that's how to ensure our survival.

1564
01:29:43.075 --> 01:29:46.165
Otherwise, we are just repeating and repeating

1565
01:29:46.165 --> 01:29:47.645
and repeating, okay?

1566
01:29:47.665 --> 01:29:50.085
And then this kind of, uh, mentality

1567
01:29:50.815 --> 01:29:54.445
might not ensure our competitiveness in a global stage.

1568
01:29:55.035 --> 01:29:57.965
Okay? So we, we need to change, we need to look

1569
01:29:57.985 --> 01:30:00.285
beyond the Philippine shore, okay?

1570
01:30:00.585 --> 01:30:02.605
So in, in, in my, uh, this slide,

1571
01:30:02.605 --> 01:30:06.325
you can see there are new rules, cloud engineer, right?

1572
01:30:06.495 --> 01:30:10.445
Which is not yet a, a job before ang.

1573
01:30:11.865 --> 01:30:16.405
And then you have here, uh, digital marketing, okay?

1574
01:30:16.585 --> 01:30:20.445
And then AI engineer, data engineer, okay?

1575
01:30:20.545 --> 01:30:24.325
So engineering might change, okay? Slightly right?

1576
01:30:24.455 --> 01:30:26.245
Aside from the current fields that they have.

1577
01:30:26.945 --> 01:30:29.685
And then they, they will also infusion of some technology,

1578
01:30:29.745 --> 01:30:31.885
as I mentioned a while ago, okay?

1579
01:30:33.675 --> 01:30:36.295
And then as the jobs are evolving, okay?

1580
01:30:36.915 --> 01:30:39.455
So other areas will be coming in.

1581
01:30:39.635 --> 01:30:41.855
So technology

1582
01:30:42.035 --> 01:30:43.095
and, uh,

1583
01:30:43.095 --> 01:30:45.575
digital transformation will be coming into

1584
01:30:45.575 --> 01:30:46.695
the picture, okay?

1585
01:30:47.115 --> 01:30:48.935
And then, uh, bear in mind,

1586
01:30:48.995 --> 01:30:52.735
as we become more engaged in the digital infrastructure,

1587
01:30:53.445 --> 01:30:57.535
okay, digital transformation, uh, there is another jobs

1588
01:30:57.535 --> 01:31:00.375
that are coming in, Yung, Yung Cybersecurity.

1589
01:31:00.635 --> 01:31:04.455
So these are, uh, the professionals protecting

1590
01:31:05.275 --> 01:31:07.735
our digital version.

1591
01:31:08.955 --> 01:31:12.095
So they are the one, uh, protecting our data,

1592
01:31:12.185 --> 01:31:15.535
protecting our infrastructure from those, uh,

1593
01:31:15.545 --> 01:31:17.255
cyber criminals, okay?

1594
01:31:17.255 --> 01:31:20.855
Because the cyber criminals exploits our data, okay?

1595
01:31:20.855 --> 01:31:23.415
That causes us harm, Eva.

1596
01:31:23.915 --> 01:31:28.295
And then, uh, these people, uh,

1597
01:31:31.305 --> 01:31:36.265
we call it a more, uh, requires more,

1598
01:31:36.765 --> 01:31:38.225
uh, skills, okay?

1599
01:31:38.325 --> 01:31:42.425
And then, uh, a more, uh, mature, okay?

1600
01:31:42.455 --> 01:31:45.625
Because, uh, working into this field is not a joke.

1601
01:31:46.205 --> 01:31:50.025
It is really, uh, a matter of,

1602
01:31:50.285 --> 01:31:51.665
uh, dedication.

1603
01:31:52.005 --> 01:31:56.825
It is really a matter of, uh, uh, presence of mind in trying

1604
01:31:56.845 --> 01:31:58.465
to solve the issue, okay?

1605
01:31:58.885 --> 01:32:02.505
You cannot have a mentality of, uh, blaming your team.

1606
01:32:02.525 --> 01:32:04.145
You need to look for a solution

1607
01:32:04.535 --> 01:32:07.265
because, uh, the key here is the data.

1608
01:32:08.085 --> 01:32:12.105
And then once the data is compromised, it might lead

1609
01:32:12.105 --> 01:32:14.705
to the disadvantage of your company, okay?

1610
01:32:14.765 --> 01:32:18.705
And in greater extent, legal battles later on,

1611
01:32:18.705 --> 01:32:20.905
because the other company may sue you

1612
01:32:21.055 --> 01:32:25.145
because of your negligence in protecting their data, right?

1613
01:32:25.165 --> 01:32:29.825
So you see, so the, this is how, uh, cybersecurity, uh,

1614
01:32:29.895 --> 01:32:33.785
professionals are really, uh, subjected

1615
01:32:33.785 --> 01:32:35.425
to this kind of, uh, thing.

1616
01:32:35.735 --> 01:32:40.705
Okay? So, okay, I won't play this. I will play.

1617
01:32:41.325 --> 01:32:43.745
All right? Okay, so for the last line, okay.

1618
01:32:43.805 --> 01:32:46.865
So all I can say is that, uh, we need to build a,

1619
01:32:46.985 --> 01:32:48.945
a more connected future, meaning to say,

1620
01:32:49.075 --> 01:32:50.585
connecting the present to the future.

1621
01:32:51.365 --> 01:32:55.185
So we, we need to have a, uh, future, okay?

1622
01:32:55.735 --> 01:32:58.985
That are responsive to the needs. Okay?

1623
01:32:59.445 --> 01:33:02.825
And in, in general also, the future will always be uncertain

1624
01:33:02.825 --> 01:33:04.545
because we don't know what will be in the future,

1625
01:33:05.365 --> 01:33:08.105
but with the latest technology, we can have a glimpse of

1626
01:33:08.105 --> 01:33:10.465
that possibility or an insight.

1627
01:33:11.165 --> 01:33:16.145
And then, uh, as an engineer, as a scientist,

1628
01:33:16.855 --> 01:33:20.575
okay, we need to think outside the box.

1629
01:33:21.125 --> 01:33:24.375
Okay? We need to think critically, rationally,

1630
01:33:25.035 --> 01:33:26.935
and science-based, okay?

1631
01:33:27.495 --> 01:33:29.455
Approach is the, this, the key

1632
01:33:29.635 --> 01:33:31.295
to be future ready, professional.

1633
01:33:31.795 --> 01:33:35.975
So we need to have a solid base of all of this.

1634
01:33:36.395 --> 01:33:38.455
We cannot just say based on my guts,

1635
01:33:38.455 --> 01:33:39.615
based on what I've heard.

1636
01:33:40.075 --> 01:33:43.015
So all of this must be based on science,

1637
01:33:43.745 --> 01:33:47.375
based on rational, uh, thinking, okay?

1638
01:33:47.375 --> 01:33:49.375
Only then we could have this, uh, what we call

1639
01:33:49.895 --> 01:33:53.335
a more responsive, a more critical workforce,

1640
01:33:53.755 --> 01:33:56.655
and soon to be leaders in the industry.

1641
01:33:57.475 --> 01:34:00.215
So with that, I think, uh, that's it.

1642
01:34:00.345 --> 01:34:03.135
Thank you and have a great day.
